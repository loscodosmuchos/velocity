## Act 1: The Problem (90 seconds)
### Opening Hook
**"Workforce management today is reactive chaos..."**

### Talking Points
- 10 different expert roles making decisions in silos
- Critical information arrives too late to prevent costly mistakes
- Manual processes eating 15-20 hours per week per role
- Budget overruns discovered AFTER money is spent
- Compliance gaps found DURING audits (too late!)

### Demo Action
**No clicks yet** - just set context while showing Executive Dashboard

---

## Act 2: AI-Powered Early Detection (3 minutes)
### Pain Points Solved
1. **CPO**: Budget exhaustion with time remaining (85% spent, 45 days left)
2. **Finance Controller**: Invoice variance detection (18% discrepancy)
3. **Legal Counsel**: Proactive compliance gap alerts

### Click Path
```
Dashboard (already visible)
  └─ AI-Generated Insights card
      ├─ Critical: Budget Overrun Prediction (2 POs at risk)
      │   └─ ROI: $150K/year in emergency procurement avoidance
      ├─ High: Invoice Variance Detected (1 invoice)
      │   └─ ROI: $300K/year in billing error prevention
      └─ Click "View All Insights" button
```

### Narration
> "Notice the AI doesn't wait for you to ask - it's already analyzed your entire operation and surfaced the top 3 risks requiring immediate attention. The CPO knows BEFORE budget exhaustion, not after."

### ROI Callout
**$450K/year** from early detection alone

---

## Act 3: User-Centric Intelligence (3 minutes)
### Pain Points Solved
1. **CPO**: Excel-like data scanning for procurement workflows
2. **Finance Controller**: Budget health visible at a glance
3. **VMS Director**: Compliance status immediately visible

### Click Path
```
Sidebar: Purchase Orders
  ├─ Observe: Budget health badges (Green/Yellow/Red)
  ├─ Click: "Striped" toggle (Excel-style alternating rows)
  ├─ Click: "Compact" toggle (fit more data on screen)
  ├─ Click: Budget badge "90% Used" on PO #2401
  │   └─ Shows: Detailed burn rate, projection, risk level
  └─ Hover: Clickable elements (vendor, contractor, amounts)
      └─ ROI: 12-15 hours/week saved in data hunting
```

### Narration
> "Every element is clickable because we anticipated what the CPO wants to know next. No guessing, no hunting through menus. The table adapts to how THEY work - striped for readability, compact for power users scanning hundreds of POs."

### ROI Callout
**$400K/year** in time savings (15 hours/week × $80/hour × 10 roles × 50 weeks)

---

## Act 4: Role-Based Perspective (2 minutes)
### Pain Points Solved
1. **All Personas**: Cognitive overload from irrelevant menus
2. **Field Supervisor**: Simple contractor-focused view
3. **C-Suite**: Strategic-only navigation

### Click Path
```
Sidebar Footer: Shield icon (Role Switcher)
  ├─ Current: Admin view (full menu)
  ├─ Click: Shield → Switch to "Client"
  │   └─ Observe: Menu filters to essentials
  │   └─ Observe: Admin-only items hidden
  ├─ Click: Shield → Switch back to "Admin"
  │   └─ Menu expands to full admin options
```

### Narration
> "The system adapts to who you are. A Field Supervisor sees contractor management - that's it. The CPO sees procurement, budget, vendor analytics. No clutter, no distraction, just what matters for YOUR job."

### ROI Callout
**User satisfaction** - reduced training time, faster adoption

---

## Act 5: Proactive Notifications (2 minutes)
### Pain Points Solved
1. **All Personas**: Information arrives when needed, not when asked
2. **Finance Controller**: Invoice anomalies before payment
3. **VMS Director**: Certification expiration warnings

### Click Path
```
TopNav: Alerts badge (showing "1")
  ├─ Click: Alerts
  │   └─ See: Critical budget overrun prediction
  │   └─ See: High invoice variance alert
  ├─ TopNav: Notifications badge (showing "3")
  │   └─ Click: Notifications
  │       ├─ Timecard submitted (Sarah Chen - Week 45)
  │       ├─ Contract expiring soon (Marcus Rodriguez - 15 days)
  │       └─ Invoice processed successfully
  ├─ Demo: "Simulate Alerts" button (sidebar footer)
  │   └─ Observe: Badges increment, new alerts appear
  └─ Click: "Clear All" to dismiss
```

### Narration
> "The system doesn't wait for you to check dashboards. Critical issues push to you immediately with severity indicators and direct action links. The Finance Controller sees invoice variance BEFORE approving payment."

### ROI Callout
**$250K/year** in early issue detection

---

## Act 6: The Payoff (90 seconds)
### ROI Summary Slide
```
Executive Dashboard → Bottom section
  ├─ Active Contractors: 10 ($400K time savings)
  ├─ Total Budget: $1.4M (managed efficiently)
  ├─ Budget Utilization: 63% (healthy, predictable)
  └─ Active Alerts: 1 (proactive, not reactive)
```

### Final Narration
> "Here's what this means in real dollars:
> - **$400K/year** - Time savings across 10 expert roles (15 hours/week recovered)
> - **$450K/year** - Early budget/invoice issue detection
> - **$200K/year** - Compliance cost avoidance
