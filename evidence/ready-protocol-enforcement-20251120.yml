notes: |
  Implemented 4-layer Protocol Enforcement System per architect's million-dollar design:
  1. Intention Beacon (12 tokens) - docs/INTENTION_BEACON.md
  2. Enforced Gating Script - scripts/ready_gate.cjs
  3. Evidence File Schema - evidence/TEMPLATE.yml
  4. Pre-Message Checkpoint - scripts/ready_prompt.cjs
  
  Scripts verified working:
  - npm run ready:prompt ✅
  - npm run ready:gate (without evidence) ✅
  
  Next test: Run ready:gate with this evidence file.
