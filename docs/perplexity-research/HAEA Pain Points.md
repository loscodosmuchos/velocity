## HAEA Pain Points

### Portfolio \& Project Management

- **Zero portfolio visibility** - 165 projects managed on whiteboard with no prioritization framework[^1_1]
- **No executive reporting capability** - CEO couldn't get answer about next critical project[^1_1]
- **Arbitrary priority assignments** - Everything treated as "number one" priority[^1_1]
- **No project interdependency tracking** - Delays cascade without visibility[^1_1]
- **Inconsistent project documentation** - PMs use 10-line vs 1,700-line plans with no standards[^1_1]


### Technology Infrastructure

- **All headquarters switches end-of-life** - Staff buying replacements on eBay during power outage[^1_1]
- **Complete absence of documentation** - No network maps, configs, or dependency records[^1_2]
- **No proactive technology planning** - Infrastructure refresh only created after emergency[^1_1]
- **Failed DR capabilities** - Critical systems have no failover; recent DR test showed 100% downtime[^1_2]


### Vendor \& Cost Management

- **Reactive procurement hemorrhaging \$500K** - Simple 3-week switch upgrades outsourced for \$500K[^1_1]
- **Vendors exploiting lack of planning** - E-Plus, SHI charging premium rates for junior engineers[^1_1]
- **No negotiation power** - Artificial urgency eliminates cost control[^1_1]
- **Emergency SOWs without price consideration** - Crisis mode procurement with no competitive bidding[^1_2]


### Resource \& Capacity Planning

- **Entirely reactive resource allocation** - PMs "buried" with no visibility into workload[^1_1]
- **No advance resource forecasting** - Last-minute "need someone now" requests[^1_2]
- **Manual monthly capacity planning** - 15 hours/week administrative burden across PMs[^1_1]
- **Hallway project assignments** - Projects assigned via casual conversations with no process[^1_1]


### Operational Processes

- **Manual PowerPoint status compilation** - Weekly reports built by hand with no automation[^1_2]
- **Zero knowledge management** - P1 incidents relearned repeatedly with no knowledge base[^1_2]
- **No onboarding structure** - New PMs get laptop and "good luck" with 3-minute training[^1_2]
- **No change management process** - Single switch upgrade impacts 19 sites without notification process[^1_2]

## HAEA Pain Points: Classified for Healing

The pain points have been **organized into a multi-dimensional taxonomy** that reveals patterns and pathways to transformation.[^2_1][^2_2]

### Classification Dimensions

**By Department** (where the pain manifests):

- **PMO (13)** - Project Management Office bears the brunt
- **IT Operations (7)** - Infrastructure chaos
- **Procurement (4)** - Cost hemorrhaging
- **HR/Talent (3)** - Resource blindness
- **Executive (2)** - Strategic visibility gap

**By System Category** (what technology domain):

- **Project Management (9)** - Core portfolio dysfunction
- **Knowledge Management (4)** - Institutional amnesia
- **IT Infrastructure (4)** - Hardware crisis
- **Procurement/VMS (6)** - Vendor exploitation
- **HRIS/Resource Management (5)** - Capacity invisibility

**By Problem Genre** (what type of challenge):

- **Process Failure (7)** - Missing workflows and governance
- **Visibility Gap (3)** - Can't see what's happening
- **Risk Management Failure (5)** - Reactive firefighting
- **Manual Process Waste (2)** - Administrative burden
- **Strategic Planning Gap (2)** - No forward view


### Root Causes: What's Missing

**Top 5 Deficiency Patterns**:[^2_1]

1. **Lack of Process (7)** - No formal workflows exist
2. **Lack of Planning (6)** - Everything is reactive
3. **Lack of System (4)** - No technology platform
4. **Lack of Documentation (4)** - Zero institutional knowledge
5. **Lack of Information (3)** - Can't see the data

### Communication Breakdown Types

The pain points reveal **40 distinct communication failure modes**:[^2_2][^2_1]

- **Status/Awareness** - Can't answer "what's happening"
- **Strategic Communication** - Executive embarrassment
- **Impact Awareness** - Downstream effects invisible
- **Knowledge Transfer** - Repeated learning failures
- **Formal Communication** - Hallway assignments


### What's Needed to HEAL (Not Destroy)

Instead of demolishing problems, **create conditions for health**:[^2_2][^2_1]

**Enable Visibility**

- Unified portfolio dashboard replacing whiteboards
- Real-time dependency mapping
- Automated status aggregation

**Establish Flow**

- Formal intake and prioritization processes
- Automated workflows for procurement/SOWs
- Change management with impact analysis

**Build Memory**

- Knowledge base capturing incident resolutions
- Standardized templates and runbooks
- Automated documentation generation

**Create Capacity**

- Resource forecasting 3-6 months forward
- Workload visibility heatmaps
- Proactive staffing pipeline

**Install Intelligence**

- Predictive analytics for bottlenecks
- Risk alerts before crises
- AI-powered recommendations


### Severity Analysis

**Critical (10)**: Existential threats requiring immediate intervention - portfolio blindness, infrastructure EOL, DR failure, procurement chaos[^2_1]

**High (11)**: Significant operational drag - capacity planning waste, knowledge gaps, onboarding failures[^2_1]

The classification reveals that **HAEA's pain isn't random chaos**—it's a **systematic absence of foundational capabilities** across process, planning, documentation, and systems. The healing path isn't about destroying dysfunction; it's about **establishing the missing connective tissue** that allows natural organizational flow.[^2_3][^2_2][^2_1]
