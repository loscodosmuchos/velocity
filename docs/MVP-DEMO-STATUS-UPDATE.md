## 🎙️ VOICE-FIRST DIFFERENTIATION (NEW CAPABILITY)

### **Competitive Advantage:**
**NO VMS competitor has voice-first contract intelligence**

### **Implementation Status:**
- ❌ **Not Started** - High priority for demo differentiation
- **Timeline:** 4-5 hours for MVP (per research)
- **Cost:** $20K/year for production capability

### **Demo Scenario:**
```
User: "I emailed my MSA contract 5 minutes ago."
System: *Phone rings* "Hi, I've analyzed your Master Service Agreement. 
        It's a 4-year, $2.3M fixed-fee SOW with 27 resources. 
        What would you like to know?"
User: "What are the termination terms?"
System: "90 days notice without cause, 30 days for cause, 
        with a 3-month transition period. Shall I flag 
        any compliance risks?"
```

**WOW Factor:** Instant contract intelligence via conversation
