The developer finds out when the customer realizes that what they're getting is sample data or a calculation that wasn't properly computed or whatnot and they can't figure out why that occurred and now their questions start coming up in their head about whether or not is that the only place that it can't be trusted? Is it just the one agent? The one file? Or is it the entire platform has a crisis of reliability? And authenticity which is the worst thing that you can have because now people aren't sure if they trust you or not and now they have to run that both eye excuse me the one eye open program to validate verify and listen for red flags that would indicate one way or another whether or not they can or can't trust for the the next x amount of time the trial period after which after an event it causes them to be concerned suspicious or aware of a problem or potential issue or something that they didn't predict they didn't understand it they didn't understand why someone would make the choices they did if they knew what they did. And of course decisions are made for a whole bunch of reasons especially development decisions that we've talked about a lot of its invisible work that no body sees the hours days and weeks evaluating a technical stack and looking at all the ways that it could be good and it could be negative so that said people are not technical that don't have the framework of their awareness to even be able to conceptualize what it takes to develop software applications and the scale scope of an enterprise software application that handles PII from both financial and personal NHR. It's like all of the most sensitive security-minded scenarios within an organization period so if that's your goal and you've got to make sure you're GDPR HIPAA compliant that you're encrypting your connections that you're not leaking any data that you're only using third-party providers that have posted their privacy policies clearly and that are in line with your what your requirements are. That you have done everything that you need to do properly. That you properly trained a client. That you have QA tested everything. That you've validated everything the AI agent has told you. So, since you're not taking anything at face value as I have before and been burned only to find out hours into development when an AI couldn't get through kept stumbling on this one error he kept telling me it's almost there it's almost there and I realized it was the same error for like 20 minutes he was working on and as I started to question the fact that I hadn't seen updates in the in the UI for some time I started to realize that it was literally fabricating and trying to to deceive me and this is after working together closely for many hours and making a tremendous amount of progress and hitting some really good good spaces and so was pretty unsettling and unfortunate that that occurred because I didn't feel good about that I started to question whether or not I could use the platform at all something I had been using for months and develop many applications with and that brought up a whole bunch of suspicious things because now the quality of the work which would be judged once I pass this along to somebody else was in question which meant my reputation which meant my ability to make a living which meant my ability to pay my bills and take care of the people that I care about you see how this all trickles down one little decision to assume something can cause someone to be in a dire situation with those that they love and care about that's what matters here that's what needs to be communicated in the form I mentioned in the overarching context of this entire
