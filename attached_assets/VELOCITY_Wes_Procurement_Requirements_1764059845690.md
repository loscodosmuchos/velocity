# Velocity Platform - Wes & Procurement Demo Requirements

## 1. Core Objective
Demonstrate "Competence, Awareness, and Capability" specifically for Procurement (Wes), differentiating their high-intensity needs from other stakeholders (PMs, Engineering, etc.).

## 2. The "Wes" Procurement Dashboard (KPIs & Metrics)
*   **Differentiated View:** Must be visually distinct from the General Dashboard.
*   **Top-Level KPIs:**
    *   **Spend vs. Budget:** Real-time variance analysis.
    *   **Contract Compliance:** % of active vendors with valid insurance/MSA.
    *   **Vendor Performance Score:** Aggregate of quality, timeliness, and cost.
    *   **Risk Exposure:** Dollar value of "at risk" contracts (expiring, non-compliant).
*   **Procurement-Specific Workflow:**
    *   **RFP/RFQ Automation:** One-click generation of solicitation documents.
    *   **Purchase Order (PO) Burndown:** Visual tracking of PO exhaustion.

## 3. The "Chaos to Control" Narrative
*   **Noise Cancellation:** The demo must show how the system filters out irrelevant data for Wes, showing *only* what needs immediate decision.
*   **The "Personal Assistant" Concept:**
    *   **Email Drafting:** AI agents drafting vendor correspondence (claims, disputes, renewals) with full context (Ticket ID, Clause reference).
    *   **Voice-to-Action:** "Call" the AI to handle Timecards or Status Updates in <30 seconds.
    *   **Proactive Advocacy:** The system fights battles for the user (e.g., flagging a missing SLA credit).

## 4. Task Breakdown (Micro-Tasks)
*   **Standard Task:** "Vendor Renewal"
    *   *Micro-Task 1:* AI alerts 90 days prior.
    *   *Micro-Task 2:* AI analyzes spend history & market rates.
    *   *Micro-Task 3:* AI drafts renewal email with negotiated terms.
    *   *Micro-Task 4:* User approves draft -> Sent.

## 5. Success Definition
*   **Quantifiable Impact:** "This workflow saved 4 hours of research and $12k in potential overspend."
*   **User Feeling:** Relief ("It's handled"), Control ("I know what's happening"), and Empowerment ("I can focus on strategy").
