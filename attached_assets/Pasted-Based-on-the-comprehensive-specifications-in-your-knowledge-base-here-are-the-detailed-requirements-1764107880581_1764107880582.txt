Based on the comprehensive specifications in your knowledge base, here are the detailed requirements and strategy for ensuring all necessary fields and datapoints for Velocity test data for client demos:

## Core Data Requirements for Demo Success

### Critical Entity Fields

**Contractor/Candidate Records**
- Personal identifiers: Name, email, phone, lifecycle state (prospect → candidate → active → terminated)
- Resume data: Skills, experience years, parsed resume text with embeddings for semantic search
- Compliance: I-9 verification dates, E-Verify status, background check status
- Employment details: Hire date, hourly rate, client billable rate, escalation rules
- Assignments: Vendor ID, PO ID, manager ID, location ID

**Project Portfolio (165 projects for Hyundai demo)**
- Project metadata: Name, owner, budget, timeline, status
- Health scoring: RAG status (Red/Amber/Green) with trend indicators
- Dependency mapping: Blocked-by and blocks relationships
- Budget variance: Actual vs planned with percentage calculations
- Resource allocation: Team member utilization percentages

**Purchase Orders & Vendor Management**
- PO details: Number, amount, status, created date
- Vendor information: Name, spend amounts, performance scores, contract terms
- Budget tracking: Variance percentages with color-coded alerts
- Approval workflows: Progress bars showing 2 of 3 approvers signed off
- Invoice matching: PO-to-invoice reconciliation data

**Infrastructure Assets (19 remote sites)**
- Asset inventory: Equipment type, location, installation date
- EOL tracking: End-of-life dates for switches and hardware
- Dependency networks: Which sites depend on which infrastructure
- Replacement costs: Financial impact of asset failures

## Demo-Specific Test Data Strategy

### Why Realistic Data Matters
1. **Executive credibility**: CPO and CFO audiences need recognizable scenarios
2. **Workflow validation**: Demonstrates actual pain point resolution
3. **Performance testing**: Ensures system handles realistic data volumes
4. **Story coherence**: Data must support narrative flow across demo acts

### Essential Demo Scenarios

**Act 1: Portfolio Crisis (Active Directory)**
- 165 total projects with realistic distribution (78 in-flight, 45 on-hold, 32 planning, 10 closed)
- 5 critical projects highlighted as "At Risk"
- Active Directory project blocking 6 dependent projects
- $2.3M value blocked quantified
- Dependencies visualized in network graph

**Act 2: Vendor Cost Overrun**
- E-Plus vendor: $450K/year actual spend
- SHI vendor: $380K/year market benchmark
- 18% cost overrun calculated
- Contract clauses flagged (auto-renewal, unlimited liability)
- AI-generated savings recommendation: $67K-90K annually

**Act 3: Infrastructure Risk**
- 19 remote sites mapped geographically
- 2 switches past EOL (critical status)
- 4 switches within 12 months of EOL (warning status)
- $139K replacement cost calculated
- Dependency chains showing impact

**Act 4: Mobile Timecard Workflow**
- 100 pending timecards ready for approval
- Anomaly detection: Hours logged at closed Site 12
- Compliance validation: Breaks, overtime, OSHA requirements
- 10-minute approval time vs 2-hour desktop baseline

## Data Generation Requirements

### Volume Benchmarks
- **Minimum viable**: 50 projects, 25 contractors, 10 vendors, 5 sites
- **Demo optimal**: 165 projects, 150 contractors, 20 vendors, 19 sites
- **Stress test**: 500 projects, 500 contractors, 50 vendors, 50 sites

### Data Quality Criteria
1. **Temporal consistency**: Dates must follow logical sequences (hire date < start date < current date)
2. **Relational integrity**: All foreign keys must resolve (contractor → vendor → PO → project)
3. **Financial accuracy**: Budget calculations must sum correctly across hierarchies
4. **Status coherence**: Lifecycle states must follow valid transitions
5. **Compliance flags**: I-9, E-Verify, background checks must have realistic statuses

### Hybrid Search Enablement
- **Text fields**: Resumes, job descriptions, project notes must be search-indexed
- **Vector embeddings**: Generate semantic embeddings for 384-dimension pgvector
- **BM25 keywords**: Tag fields for keyword search (skills, project names, vendor names)
- **Test queries**: "Senior React developer", "projects over budget in Q4", "vendors with compliance gaps"

## Technical Implementation

### Database Population
```sql
-- Example test data structure
INSERT INTO persons (company_id, firstname, lastname, email, lifecycle_state)
VALUES 
  ('tenant-uuid', 'John', 'Smith', 'jsmith@example.com', 'candidate'),
  ('tenant-uuid', 'Sarah', 'Johnson', 'sjohnson@example.com', 'activecontractor');

-- Budget variance calculations
UPDATE projects 
SET budget_variance = ((actual_spend - budgeted_amount) / budgeted_amount) * 100
WHERE project_status = 'in-flight';
```

### Integration Data Requirements
- **NetSuite ERP**: PO amounts, statuses, payment dates
- **Jira**: Project names, dependencies, sprint data
- **Salesforce**: Vendor logos, contact information
- **ADP/Workday**: Employee roster, contractor assignments
- **Checkr**: Background check statuses
- **E-Verify**: I-9 compliance flags

## Demo-Specific Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Page load**: 2 seconds for 100 records
- **Filter response**: 500ms
- **Search results**: 1 second with typeahead after 3 characters
- **Mobile responsiveness**: 80% feature parity on tablet/phone

### User Acceptance Criteria
- CPO can answer "What's our vendor spend?" in 10 seconds
- PM can identify budget overruns in 3 clicks
- Finance can export POs for audit in 30 seconds
- Field Supervisor can approve timecards from phone in 10 minutes
