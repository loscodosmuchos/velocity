Side note when you have available cycles don't stop what you're doing for this just wanted to note it Interesting I like this page this is good again I think it needs to be condensed it takes up way too much space for the information amount and it requires scrolling and you know how I feel about that unnecessarily also this is helpful in two ways number one it's letting the client know how they could save a bunch of money you know using the technology that's available by adding another configuration and you know invoice automation opportunity identified to save 73 or to save thirty-one thousand dollars a year this is great it requires the developer to create another module for the program and then they can utilize it to get the insights so what I would say is that this opportunity should be notifying the velocity developers or the sales lead the account rep who handles this account should also be notified of this and probably first because it requires development so if it requires development then we should be notified first and then we can decide if we want to allow that to be suggested since it's it would take our resources I'm sure I don't see any reason why I wouldn't say yes but it could be an opportunity for an upsell or a consult consultation where we we curate this analysis and then we put our special touch on it where the account rep gets notified hey on one of your accounts has some innovations to review this is she goes into the portal she sees this one under the that client and then she has some options there she can click a button that says send email to this you know the primary stakeholder at a procurement let's say with this opportunity and then yeah then it will be put in a templated sort of email with all the personalization including what they'll be able to do sorry not an email it will go into the portal from portal account to portal account it will show up in his he'll get notified he'll log in he'll see this hey look we are the platform has identified some ways that we can save you this much money and improvement and here's what's gonna be involved maybe it's free maybe it's gonna cost you this many hours maybe it's you know here's what here's the cost here's the benefit this is pretty cool what you think you want us to do it and then he may say yes he may say yes with these changes or can you modify to do this or might just say yeah that sounds great how long is gonna take and then we can advise they'll take a few days should be done next week or tomorrow or whatever but that gives an opportunity to engage to knowledge the inside and make a record of it record that was talked about and implemented on a given day and that keeps the engagement up it keeps the positivity keeps the exclamations going mean as well as its a reason to exclaim reason for the count rep to exclaim to the company rep and vice versa and for them to explain back wow this is cool you can do this yes tomorrow yes it's gonna cost this yes or no or whatever or nothing that just comes as part of the platform will do this for you we identify these will implement them and then for that we take half a percent or a percent of the total revenue flowing through platform or however we arrange it with them so which is already in place this is just after the fact and it's running so you get the idea we want the insights to come up we want to go through an account rep first to approve them then they show up modified or curated if need be to the stakeholder then they decide to implement it if there's a decision be made and that goes into a queue like a ticket queue for modifications improvements upgrades whatever the wording is that are tied to that stakeholder like requests made by the stakeholder will show up in his account because they're associated with him and he'll be able to see the status on it and converse on that ticket and all that stuff and then I'll get notified when it's ready to go into test
