VIN Strategic Workforce Console - Enhancement Requirements

Executive Summary

Based on client feedback and user testing sessions, we have identified critical improvements needed for the VIN Strategic Workforce Console demo to enhance client engagement and demonstrate our platform's value proposition effectively.

Critical User Experience Issues

1. AI Assistant Continuity

Issue: Users experience conversation interruption when navigating between dashboard views
Business Impact: Disrupts client demo flow and creates frustration during presentations
Resolution Required: Maintain conversation context across all dashboard sections

2. Internationalization Completeness

Business Impact: Incomplete localization undermines credibility with international clients
Resolution Required: Full content translation when language preference is selected

Issue: Text overflow in analytics sections affects professional appearance
Business Impact: Reduces perceived platform quality during client demonstrations
Resolution Required: Proper text formatting and layout optimization
