Yes, let's break that down:
- Dashboard: this is our sight, our vision, what we see. The literal colors, the placement, the balance of the screen, the size of the things, how they are in relation to each other, the perspective that it provides. Does it? Is it balanced? Are things too big? Are they too small? Are they not contrasted enough? Are they readable?
- Worthy: do they not instantly give the user the feeling of something worthy, of godlike or impressive, powerful, that they just look at and they know, "Wow, this is not, this is different. This is not the same." And not only is it different, but "Wow, I can't wait to see what's possible with this."
- When I connect with this platform, what I'll be able to do that I've never been able to do before that I can reach my potential that I can evolve that I can start spinning faster and faster and start stacking and getting momentum and building that flywheel momentum up so that it can self-sustain like a gyro once it gets up to speed.
- If I stay focused and get it to speed and use the best tools to help me stay focused and get it up to speed. Once it gets there, I can take my focus off of it for a minute and focus on these other things for myself and the company to improve things that haven't been able to receive creative attention before because they have just been stacking other things that are priorities because they can never get ahead.
- And so those things never get the attention that they probably need. If they did, it wouldn't take much. We could evolve those systems and get rid of a lot of the encumbrances that exist now, but we can't until we can get the time and the available mental clarity and cycles back to be able to put on that because until then, everything else takes priority because it's tied to actual things and money and processes and what not.
- They are as well, but people often focus on what the immediate thing is, not the system that if they put the same amount of time into that they could, they could improve things for every transaction after.
