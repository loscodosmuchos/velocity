And makes them look great is a benefit. People love things that make them look good. People love going to the hairdresser, or to the barber, or to the manicurist or the pedicurist, because- or the tanning salon- because they know that when they come out after exchanging some of their stored energy as money for this other thing they're gonna feel better, look better, be received better project better be clearer, be more stable, be more predictable and be presenting in the state that is in alignment with the image and impression they want to give. So they are- they're there giving the impression that they intend to give and they are not explaining, they are exclaiming. Big distinction: exclaim and explain. Just like this demo: you want to get on the demo and you want to be exclaiming about all the things that it solves. You want to be exclaiming about how wonderful it is to been tasked with this challenge of solving these MVP problems for this giant company with all these meaningful projects to get ahold of and the impact the stress that it's having on the company on the workers on the bottom line paying penalties and things because they were unaware of deadlines or things that are passed because details are getting dropped so there's financial impact there's emotional impact there's uh likely depression project managers are overwhelmed they can't even respond to emails or phone calls because there's so many pro projects that are constantly alerting that some other emergency happened because nobody even knew about it and meanwhile there's already other fires burning from other projects. So it's just constant chaos and impossible to manage with no tools other than paper as Des was communicating with us today so we want to get on and exclaim how wonderful it is to be in a position to be given these challenges to solve and to have tools available that we can construct the perfect solution for or at least as we can define it at this moment given the available information and pending their testing and utilization and feedback regarding the custom solutions we build for them. So we're excited about that look at these great amazing things that we've created this is why we created them this is how they can become force multipliers for you given the challenges you've iterated here are some ways that they could be used that may not be immediately obvious this is the benefits you can expect if you use them compared to traditional means Here are some Flexible hybridized approaches. We've thought about different scenarios that these might not always apply to and there may be edge cases that You need a special solution for so, you know, we built in resiliency into this thing so that it's capable of handling those edge cases as well or Here's an additional set of resources specifically for that Because we did think of that and we did want to make sure we had an option to mitigate those challenges specifically when they come up So that's the explanation oh my gosh, look what we did Look at this incredible interface and the reason why we chose this is because it Perfectly displays the information in the way that it needs to be it prioritizes This category of alert once things have hit this threshold it forces them to the top of the priority listing and highlights them in you know flashing red or whatever it might be So that there's no way that you cannot see this alert come up And also just in case you're not looking at the dashboard or you're vacationing in Hawaii at the moment and all you have is a phone Just as a example script The app can alert you when there is a threshold hit so that you're able to see that Something needs attention it needs to be paid it hasn't been paid It has been paid there's a delay in procurement We need additional suppliers we need alternate feedstock We've got a delay in available staffing contingent workforce we have a problem with documentation we have a System that's down in I.T. Like whatever the situation is. Robust alerting Based on thresholds or actions taken or the presence of something or the lack of something and so we have a Natural language based system capable of taking your input converting that into threshold and notification criteria in triggers.
