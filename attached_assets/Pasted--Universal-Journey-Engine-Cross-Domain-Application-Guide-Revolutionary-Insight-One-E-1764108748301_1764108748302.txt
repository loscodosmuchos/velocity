# 🗺️ Universal Journey Engine - Cross-Domain Application Guide

## **Revolutionary Insight: One Engine, Infinite Domains**

**The Discovery**: The journey mapping system isn't just for customer experiences - it's a **universal "verbal description → structured insights" transformation engine** that works across ANY domain where humans describe sequential experiences.

**The Pattern**:
```
Input: Unstructured verbal description
Process: AI extracts stages, emotions, touchpoints, pain points, opportunities
Output: Visual map + actionable insights
```

**Domains Validated**:
- ✅ Customer Journey (original use case)
- ✅ Work Journey (resume career paths)
- ✅ Project Journey (chaos → structured roadmap)
- ✅ Procurement Journey (vendor selection process)
- ✅ Resource Journey (team capacity → burnout → rebalancing)

## 📊 **The Core Abstraction**

### **Universal Journey Structure**

```typescript
interface UniversalJourney {
  title: string;              // Journey name
  description: string;        // Context summary
  stages: Stage[];           // Sequential phases
  insights: Insight[];       // Actionable opportunities
}

interface Stage {
  id: string;
  name: string;              // Stage name
  description: string;       // What happens
  emotion: string;           // Emotional state or sentiment
  emotionIcon: string;       // Visual representation
  touchpoints: string[];     // Interaction points
  painPoints: {              // Problems → Solutions
    issue: string;
    opportunity: string;
  }[];
  color: string;             // Visual theming
}
```

**What Changes**: Domain-specific vocabulary (stages, emotions, touchpoints)
**What Stays**: Core structure, AI parsing, visual generation, insight extraction

## 🎯 **Domain Mapping Matrix**

| Domain | Stages Example | Emotions Example | Touchpoints Example | Pain Points Example |
|--------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Customer** | Awareness → Purchase → Retention | Curious, Excited, Frustrated | Website, Support chat | "Confusing checkout → Simplify flow" |
| **Work** | Education → Entry → Growth | Learning, Challenged, Accomplished | Skills used, Projects | "Skill gap → Upskilling opportunity" |
| **Project** | Intake → Planning → Execution | Organized, Overwhelmed, Focused | Stakeholders, Tools | "Resource overload → Prioritization" |
| **Procurement** | Need → RFQ → Selection | Urgent, Evaluating, Confident | Vendors, Contracts | "Long lead times → Predictive ordering" |
| **Sales** | Prospecting → Demo → Close | Hopeful, Negotiating, Celebrating | CRM, Calls | "Deal stalls → Follow-up automation" |

## 💡 **Velocity Platform Integration**

### **Project Intake → Journey Map**

**User Story**: PM describes chaotic 165-project situation verbally

```javascript
// Input from PM (REQ-016: Conversational AI Data Collection)
const pmInput = `
We have 165 concurrent projects but no visibility. 
PMs submit requests that get stuck with managers for weeks.
Design engineers are triple-booked but nobody knows until deadlines slip.
We need to see the whole pipeline at once.
`;

// Transform to Project Journey
const projectJourney = await generateJourney(pmInput, projectJourneyDomain);

// Output
{
  title: "165-Project Portfolio Management Crisis",
  description: "Multi-project chaos requiring immediate visibility and control",

```

**System Response**: Auto-generate REQ-001 (Live RAG Dashboard), REQ-003 (Resource Heatmap), REQ-005 (Manager Feedback Latency Tracking)

### **Procurement Journey → Predictive Intelligence**

**User Story**: Procurement manager describes vendor selection chaos

```javascript
const procurementInput = `
We wait 3-6 months for specialized equipment.
By the time quotes come back, projects are delayed.
We don't know what we'll need until projects start, then it's panic ordering.
`;

// Transform to Procurement Journey
const procurementJourney = await generateJourney(procurementInput, procurementJourneyDomain);

// Output insights map to Velocity REQ-011 (Predictive Procurement Intelligence)
insights: [
  {
    type: "cost-saving",
    title: "Predictive ordering 3 months ahead could save 10-20% on rush fees",
    description: "AI analyzes project pipeline to forecast equipment needs"
  },

    type: "process-improvement",
    title: "Vendor pre-qualification reduces RFQ turnaround by 50%",
    description: "Maintain approved vendor pool with pre-negotiated terms"
  }
]
```

### **Resume Journey → Candidate Evaluation**

**User Story**: HR analyzing candidate work history

```javascript
const resumeInput = `
John Smith
Software Engineer at TechCorp (2020-2022): Built React dashboards, led team of 3
Senior Engineer at StartupXYZ (2022-2024): Architected microservices, mentored 5 engineers
`;

// Transform to Work Journey
const workJourney = await generateJourney(resumeInput, workJourneyDomain);

// Output
{
  stages: [
    {
      name: "Software Engineer - TechCorp",
      emotion: "growth",
      touchpoints: ["React", "Team leadership", "Dashboard development"],
      duration: "2020-2022 (2 years)"
    },
    {
      name: "Senior Engineer - StartupXYZ",
      emotion: "accomplished",

      title: "Full-stack with architectural experience",
      description: "React frontend + microservices backend expertise"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 **Visual Journey Map Generation**

The same visual component renders ALL journey types:

```typescript
interface JourneyMapProps {
  journey: UniversalJourney;
  variant?: 'customer' | 'work' | 'project' | 'procurement' | 'resource';
}

// Variant only changes color scheme and icon set
// Core rendering logic identical across domains
```

**Visual Adaptations by Domain**:

| Domain | Primary Color | Icon Theme | Emotion Labels |
|--------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Customer | Purple (#8B5CF6) | Faces (smile, meh, frown) | Curious, Frustrated, Satisfied |
| Work | Blue (#3B82F6) | Career (rocket, chart, briefcase) | Growth, Challenged, Accomplished |
| Project | Green (#10B981) | Tasks (clipboard, trophy) | Organized, Overwhelmed, Focused |
| Procurement | Orange (#F59E0B) | Commerce (cart, handshake, truck) | Urgent, Evaluating, Confident |
| Resource | Red (#EF4444) | Team (users, balance, alert) | Balanced, Stressed, Burned-out |

## 🚀 **Stacked Benefits: Multi-Journey Analysis**

### **Compound Intelligence Pattern**

```typescript
// Single verbal description generates MULTIPLE journey views
const chaosDescription = "165 projects, triple-booked engineers, 7 manager bottlenecks";

const insights = {
  projectJourney: await generateJourney(chaosDescription, projectJourneyDomain),
  resourceJourney: await generateJourney(chaosDescription, resourceJourneyDomain),
  
  // Cross-reference pain points
  sharedPainPoints: findOverlap(
    projectJourney.stages.flatMap(s => s.painPoints),
    resourceJourney.stages.flatMap(s => s.painPoints)
  ),
  
  // Compound solution
  comprehensiveSolution: {
    immediate: "Resource heatmap to visualize triple-booking",
    shortTerm: "Manager approval SLA automation",
    longTerm: "Predictive capacity planning 6 months ahead"
  }
};
```

### **Resume Journey + Project Journey Stack**

```typescript
// Match people to projects based on journey compatibility

// Person's work journey shows: React → Microservices → Leadership
const candidateJourney = await generateJourney(resumeText, workJourneyDomain);

// Project journey shows: Needs senior full-stack architect with mentoring
const projectJourney = await generateJourney(projectDescription, projectJourneyDomain);

// AI matches journey touchpoints
const matchScore = calculateJourneyCompatibility(
  candidateJourney.stages.flatMap(s => s.touchpoints),
  projectJourney.stages.flatMap(s => s.touchpoints)
);
// Result: 85% match (React, Microservices, Leadership all align)
```

## 📊 **Analytics: Journey Metrics**

### **Universal Metrics**

```typescript
interface JourneyAnalytics {
  // Complexity
  stageCount: number;
  avgTouchpointsPerStage: number;
  totalPainPoints: number;
  
  // Sentiment
  emotionDistribution: Record<string, number>;
  criticalStages: Stage[];  // Negative emotion + high pain points
  
  // Actionability
  opportunityCount: number;
  prioritizedInsights: Insight[];
  
  // Cross-journey
  sharedPatterns: Pattern[];
  divergencePoints: string[];
}
```

### **Domain-Specific Metrics**

| Domain | Custom Metrics |
|--------|---------------|
| Customer | Conversion rate impact, NPS correlation |
| Work | Career velocity, skill acquisition rate |
| Project | Schedule variance, resource burn rate |
| Procurement | Cost savings potential, lead time reduction |
| Resource | Utilization rate, burnout risk score |
