I think right now the most important thing that we can do is focus on things that are validating what we have now what we've already built but haven't validated haven't tested haven't evaluated the workflows haven't reviewed to make sure that the data formulas are correct that what we put in and is processed by a formula or a function exports what we would expect in the format style function that we would be proud of if we were the developer and or if we were receiving it as the client are we exclaiming how incredible it is the whole process how easy it was to get something that was typically super cumbersome to get or are we asking questions about why something occurred that we didn't expect and why we still haven't gotten the output where it is that and not that and um when do we think that will be ready because it looks good but if they can't use it right and all those things create doubt and they create a precarious bridge between the development side and the customer and we want that to always be exclamations of excitement from the developer sales team support team like all right look what we have now we have this new capability which is going to save you guys so much time it's going to make it so easier here let me demo for you look this thing takes two clicks instead of nine and it handles the the part about you know writing the email to the people that need the email written it'll pull the context in pre-fill it out with all their details all you got to do is look at it make sure it's good and hit approve and then it will get in the queue and get sent out so you just have to be the eyes just make sure that everything looks looks proper you can modify it if you need to but it will handle it if you don't you can leave it at default and it will take care of it and then they would say something like really that's possible let me say yeah yeah we did it you want to try it absolutely I want to try it and then that's how it works then they get on and then as long as it works and does as you described they will be over the moon and excited about they won't let their co-workers know hey did you hear the new platform function does xyz you're kidding it does that really no really does serious I saw it well when do we get it I needed that like last week they said they're gonna have a for us uh at this date and then that creates anticipation etc or when they come to us then they say hey we have this thing that we're trying to do it's really hard given the fact that guys have done so much great work in the other areas can you build something for this and then they describe the problem to us and then we can run that problem through the solution workflow analyzer and that will give us some suggestions we come up with a plan to do it and then we arrange for we figure out who has access to the system that we need the data from if we don't already have that and then we build the thing and then we demo it for them and then they're even more impressed because they had an idea and you manifested into reality you understood what they said took the time and the care to build it build it right test it so that we know when we put it into their hands it's just going to work imagine the scenario if they get really excited and they give you the specs and they go home and they dream about this new function that's going to make their life so much better and their lives of all the people that depend on that function or that are involved in that workflow that hate it or that are wasting time on it and then they get up the next day and they go to work and say hey here's the app to review let me go review it and the function doesn't work in the way that they thought or described it's not intuitive and the output is not usable in its format with current format and maybe that user has a couple different things that he needs to do with that function that it was excited to do that day with a new application to test it and use it and then submit those responses to whoever needed them and they can't do any of that now they got to do it the old manual way they got to submit a ticket or call us and say hey it's not working this is not it it's not where it doesn't work correctly or i'm having all kind of problems i thought i could use it for this deadline today but now i can't and now i have to pivot while you guys fix your bugs and do it the old-fashioned way which now is taking now there's not a time for this today so i gotta rush everything you gotta ship this by this day whatever the case you can see how quickly the stress of the user would be transferred over to the development team even though we had nothing to do with the pre-existing deadlines that may have been you know beyond their due dates hence the stress that's not our issue but it will be our issue if we're providing solution for it and it's not right and they can't use it for that they will um look to blame or you know it will lessen the impact of the program in their minds and the trust level which should be off the charts is now you know not in a great space it needs more to get back up there we don't want to do that because we can foresee it that's the whole point of the program it's anticipating user responses and actions we can see that as an anticipated user response if we don't do our homework due diligence and our proper coding and planning and test it that's a very likely possibility that will happen if we don't do our jobs right that's why it's so critical to do our jobs right and to make sure we have an infrastructure built that makes positive that we are reviewing to ensure we are doing a job right constantly in our face reminders dashboard just like for them they need to know when stuff's happening so do
