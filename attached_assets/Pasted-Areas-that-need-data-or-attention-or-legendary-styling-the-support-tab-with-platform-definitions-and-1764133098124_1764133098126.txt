Areas that need data or attention or legendary styling the support tab with platform definitions and research insights the research documents again the research documents again this this whole um this whole page should belong in the admin section and then we make a secondary page actually support which is not that page but we can have a section where we talk about the platform and its design and all that and then there's actual support for them how to get in touch with us you know links to ai support bots with the faqs and knowledge base and you can ask questions of it that's what needs to be in support and it needs to be made legendary also i'm noticing when you're restarting the server often it's going just white and then you'll say something like i'm adjusting the time out before i take a screenshot but it appears that you're having to re-trigger the server to restart and it's taking a while is there a reason for that also i like the actionable insights the one comment i would say is the title of the tooltip instead of white on gold make it black on gold for the invoice automation opportunity identified make that black on gold looks nice though and then there needs to be a way to dismiss the reminder if you don't want to take action there should be a little check box that says acknowledge and dismiss and um or save for later right something like that but i really like it so far looking really good looking good this uh the detail page for the ai analysis is good i like it i really like it um a lot of color going on and you know we should make sure we don't use color arbitrarily so if you're going to use color more than once on a page the color should have some designation if it's green yellow and red then maybe it's good status you know semi and bad status or whatever but if it's not status if it's just information you're highlighting with color then it has to be related all right you can't have a red highlight on something that doesn't mean priority it's just a highlight and then you have it on something else which is completely related like it says pattern recognition results 89 of invoices under five grand are approved without modification that's and then down below two weeks time to value that's also red but the two of those have no correlation so we that's confusing so we just need to strategize about that
