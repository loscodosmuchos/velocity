## **Core Philosophy: Seeing Through the User's Eyes**

This exchange represents a **fundamental paradigm shift** from feature-focused product development to **user-anticipation-driven design**. The conversation articulates what truly matters when building software that users *choose* to use, not are forced to use.

### **The Central Question Being Answered**

"How do we understand what the user will think, want, experience, and desire—**before** they even know it themselves?"

***

## **Detailed Contextual Information**

### **The Strategic Framework: 6 Core Criteria Per Page**

The conversation establishes a comprehensive **Page Specification Template** with six dimensions of user understanding:[^1][^2][^3]

#### **1. MVP Fields**

What the user **MUST** see to accomplish their task—the absolute minimum for functionality.

#### **2. Nice-to-Have Fields**

Features that would **delight** users—elements that differentiate from merely functional to genuinely helpful.

#### **3. Click Behavior**

What happens when users click **every element**—anticipating user curiosity and exploration:

- Click PO number → opens PO detail
- Click vendor name → filters by vendor
- Click status → sorts by status
- Click date → enables date-range filtering
- Click asset → drills to asset detail + batch + employee + facility + history


#### **4. Metadata Context**

Answering the **who, when, where, what** questions for complete data lineage:

- Who created it?
- When was it created?
- Where did it come from?
- What systems does it connect to?


#### **5. User Anticipation**

The **critical differentiator**—asking:

- What would the user **try** to do?
- What would they **expect** to happen?
- What would they **assume** is clickable?


#### **6. The "Wow Factor"**

The game-changing addition requested:
> "What feature or capability would **completely blow the minds** of the people using it? Something so intuitive and contextually relevant specific to the job function that it shows a **deep understanding** of what that job function cares about and what challenges them daily."

This dimension goes beyond functionality to **anticipatory empathy**—solving problems users don't yet know they have.[^2][^3][^1]

***

## **The Discovery Question Framework**

To achieve this level of understanding, the conversation proposes **role-specific discovery questions** designed to uncover hidden pain points:

### **Purchase Orders (Procurement/Project Managers)**

- When you create a PO, what information do you desperately **wish** you had but don't?
- What's the **worst scenario**—PO created, then what goes wrong?
- How much time do you waste **hunting down** a single PO?
- What would instantly make you **trust** a PO is correct?


### **Assets/Equipment (Facility/Operations)**

- How do you know where an asset is **RIGHT NOW**?
- What's the **cost** of a missing or misplaced piece of equipment?
- When something breaks, how do you know if it's due for maintenance or if someone broke it?
- What would **prevent disasters**?


### **Expenses (Finance/Managers)**

- How many back-and-forths before an expense gets approved?
- When does a policy violation happen because the employee **didn't understand**?
- What would make expense management feel **FAST and trustworthy**?


### **Approvals (All Managers/Leadership)**

- Where do approval requests get **stuck/lost**?
- When do you approve something you **shouldn't have** (insufficient context)?
- What would make you **confident** in every approval you give?

***

## **What This Attempts to Answer About "Seeing Through the User's Eyes"**

### **1. Cognitive Load Reduction**

Every interaction should feel **intuitive**—users shouldn't have to guess what happens when they click something. The system should anticipate their mental model.

### **2. Contextual Relevance**

Understanding not just **what** users do, but **why** they do it and what information they need at that exact moment to make decisions confidently.[^3][^1]

### **3. Problem Prevention vs. Problem Solving**

The framework shifts from "how do we fix errors?" to "how do we **prevent them from happening** in the first place?" by understanding daily workflow challenges.

### **4. Emotional Experience**

The questions probe:

- What makes users **sad** or **frustrated**?
- What makes them **happy** or **relieved**?
- How do they **feel** when looking at the interface?

This emotional mapping creates **sticky** products—users feel understood.[^1][^2]

### **5. Workflow Continuity**

Every page element should support the **next logical action**:

- Asset page → click category → filtered table view
- Purchase Order → click PO\# → detail view
- Date field → click date → date-range filtering

This creates a **conversational interface**—users can explore naturally without dead ends.[^2][^3][^1]

### **6. Hidden Waste Mitigation**

The discovery questions uncover **invisible time sinks**:

- "How much time is wasted looking for the right tool/equipment?"
- "How many items disappear without resolution?"
- "What receipts get lost or disputed?"

Understanding these reveals where the **real value** lies—often not in flashy features but in eliminating daily friction.[^3]

***

## **What Matters Most (Synthesized Insights)**

### **Choice Architecture**

> "They're not being forced to use this no matter what it looks like; they have a choice to use this. We want them to want to use this over all of the platforms."

**User agency** is paramount—the product must compete on **want-to-use**, not have-to-use.[^1]

### **Proactive Problem Solving**

> "What questions do we need to ask to get the answers we need to implement features that make this the only thing they want, because it is the only thing that **actually solves their unique problems**?"

The shift from reactive (fixing what's broken) to proactive (preventing problems before they occur).[^2][^3]

### **Deep Role Understanding**

The "wow factor" criterion demands understanding:

- What the job function **cares about**
- What **challenges** them daily
- What would make their work **feel better**

This is UX as **empathy engineering**.[^1][^2]

### **Interconnected Intelligence**

Every element should be a **portal** to related information:

- Asset → batch → employee → department → facility
- PO → vendor → status → shipment tracking
- Expense → receipt → policy → approval chain

This creates a **knowledge graph interface**—users can traverse relationships intuitively.[^3][^1]

### **Trust Through Transparency**

Metadata and origin tracking answer the implicit question: "Can I trust this data?"

- Who created it?
- When?
- From where?
- What's the audit trail?

Trust is foundational to adoption.[^2][^3]

## **The Strategic Pivot Articulated**

The conversation captures a **critical realization**:

**Before:**
> "What can we build?" (feature-focused)

**After:**
> "What would a user EXPECT and TRY?" (user-anticipation-focused)

This is the difference between a **tool** (something that works) and an **application** (something people love using).[^3][^1][^2]

***

## **Implementation Philosophy**

### **Iterative User Discovery**

Before writing specs, conduct **discovery interviews** with real users in each role to validate assumptions and uncover hidden pain points.

### **Page-Level Intentionality**

Every page should be treated as **its own application**—fully considered, deliberately designed, with every element having a purpose.

### **"If They Click It, Something Should Happen" Principle**

No orphaned UI elements—if it looks clickable, it should do something meaningful and predictable.[^2][^3]

### **MVP + Delight Layering**

- **MVP:** What must be there for core functionality
- **Nice-to-Have:** What would delight users and differentiate the product
- **Wow Factor:** What would make users say "I didn't know I needed this"[^1][^2]

***

## **What the Exchange Reveals About User-Centered Design**

This conversation is a masterclass in **anticipatory design thinking**—moving beyond user research to **user empathy at scale**. It recognizes that great software doesn't just respond to user actions; it **anticipates user intent** and removes friction **before** frustration occurs.

The framework answers: **"How do we build software that users feel was made specifically for them?"** by systematically asking what they want, anticipate, try, and feel—then designing every interaction to meet those expectations intuitively.[^4][^3][^1][^2]
