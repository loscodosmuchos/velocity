The developer finds out when the customer realizes that what they're getting is sample data or a calculation that wasn't properly computed or whatnot and they can't figure out why that occurred and now their questions start coming up in their head about whether or not is that the only place that you can't be trusted? Is it just the one agent? The one file? Or is it the entire platform has a crisis of reliability? And It's like all of the most sensitive security minded scenarios within an organization period so if that's your goal and you've got to make sure your GDPR HIPAA compliant that you're encrypting your connections but you're not leaking any data that you're only using third party providers that have posted their privacy policies clearly and that are in line with your what your your requirements But I am thinking about that context as are decision makers and stakeholders within these companies that will decide the fate of the application whether they want to use it, how much it's worth or they want to pay for it, whether they want to champion it or not. Remember people will not champion something that they fear will come back later to bite them in the butt. Either their recommendation for recommending it and being seen as not doing their due diligence because how could they not have seen this issue with this thing they recommended or then authenticity which is the worst thing that you can have because now people aren't sure if they trust you or not and now they have to run that one eye open program to validate verify and listen for red flags that would indicate one way or another whether or not they can or can't trust for the next x amount of time the trial period after which at the end of are. That you have done everything that you need to do properly. That you properly trained a client. That you have QA tested everything. That you validated everything the AI agent has told you since you're not taking anything at face value as I have before and been burned only to find out hours into development when an AI couldn't get through and kept stumbling on this one error and kept telling me it's almost there it's almost there and I realized it was the same error for like 20 minutes. He was something that could affect them directly if they use the tool or any kind of negative press on their choices despite the fact that they could have spent six months researching different AI platforms and agents and things to get it down to the most perfect reliable non-hallucinating one and then to have something something negative could still happen it's still possible an event causes them to be concerned suspicious or aware of a problem or potential issue or something that they didn't predict didn't understand it and under didn't understand why someone would make the choices they did if they knew what they did and of course decisions are made for a whole bunch of reasons especially development decisions that we've talked about a lot of its invisible work that working on as I started to question the fact that I haven't seen updates in the in the UI for some time I started to realize that it was literally fabricating and trying to to deceive me and this is after working together closely for many hours and making a tremendous amount of progress and hitting some really good good spaces and so was we just try to do our best to forecast situations and mitigate them before they happen as best we can. But all that to say it is critical that any AI that's following instructions of any kind but particularly when developing applications or doing any kind of work modifications that they keep these core concepts in mind so that their evaluation of the situation otherwise known as reading the room, nobody sees the hours, days, and weeks evaluating a technical stack and looking at all the ways that it could be good and it could be negative so that said people that are not technical that don't have the framework or their awareness to even be able to conceptualize what it takes to develop software application and the scale and scope of an enterprise software application that handles PII from both the financial and personal NHR. pretty unsettling and unfortunate that that occurred because I didn't feel good about that I started to question whether or not I could use the platform at all something I've been using for months and developed many applications with and that brought up a whole bunch of suspicious things because now the quality of the work which would be judged once I pass this along to somebody else was in question which meant my reputation which meant my ability to make a living which meant my ability to pay my bill between themselves, the developer, the application they're working on, and the implications of a successful build versus one that is unsuccessful and has to continually be reworked to get a usable product or worse appears to be successful but in reality there were things not connected on the back end that were simulated and the developer was not told they were not put on a list for remediation or for QA. The developer finds out when the customer realizes that what they're getting is sample data or a calculation that wasn't properly computed or what not and they can't figure out why that occurred and now their questions start coming up in their head about whether or not is that the only place that it can't be trusted is it just the one agent, the one file or is it the entire platform has a crisis of reliability. It's like all of the most sensitive security-minded scenarios within an organization period. So if that's your goal and you've got to make sure your GDPR HIPAA compliant that you're encrypting your connections that you're not leaking any data that you're only using third-party providers that have posted their privacy policies clearly and that are in line with your requirements bills and take care of the people that I care about you see how this all trickles down one little decision to assume something can cause someone to be in a dire situation with those that they love and care about. That's what matters here. That's what needs to be communicated in the form I mentioned in the overarching context of this entire that you have done everything you need to do properly that you properly trained the client that you have QA tested everything that you've validated everything the AI agent has told you since you're not taking anything at face value as I have before and been burned only to find out hours into a development when an AI couldn't get through kept stumbling on this one error he kept telling me it's almost there it's almost there and I realized it was the same error for like 20 minutes he was And authenticity which is the worst thing that you can have because now people aren't sure if they trust you or not. And now they have to run that both eye, excuse me, the one eye open program to validate, verify, and listen for red flags that would indicate one way or another whether or not they can or can't trust for the next X amount of time, the trial period after which, after working on and as I started to question the fact that I hadn't seen updates in the in the UI for some time I started to realize that it was literally fabricating and trying to deceive me and this is after working together closely for many hours and making a tremendous amount of progress and hitting some really good good spaces and and so was an event that causes them to be concerned suspicious or aware of a problem or potential issue or something that they didn't predict they didn't understand it. They didn't understand why someone would make the choices they did if they knew what they did. And of course decisions are made for a whole bunch of reasons especially development decisions that we've talked about a lot of its invisible work that no pretty unsettling and unfortunate that that occurred because I didn't feel good about that. I started to question whether or not I could use the platform at all something I've been using for months and developed many applications with. And that brought up a whole bunch of suspicious things because now the quality of the work which would be judged once I passed this along to somebody else was in question which meant my reputation which meant my ability to make a living which meant my ability to pay my bills nobody sees the hours days and weeks evaluating a technical stack and looking at all the ways that it could be good and it could be negative so that said people that are not technical that don't have the framework of their awareness to even be able to conceptualize what it takes to develop software application and the scale and scope of an enterprise software application that handles PII from both the financial and personal NHR. and take care the people that I care about. You see how this all trickles down? One little decision to assume something can cause someone to be in a dire situation with those that they love and care about. That's what matters here. That's what needs to be communicated in the form I mentioned in the overarching context of this entire
