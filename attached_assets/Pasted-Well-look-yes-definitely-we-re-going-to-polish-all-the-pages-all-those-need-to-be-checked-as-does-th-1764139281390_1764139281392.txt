Well look yes definitely we're going to polish all the pages all those need to be checked as does the site map unless that's already been done and again everything in parallel that can be done that way plan your work and then work your plan plan with the intent to do as much as little as possible in it as much get as much done in this little time possible with intelligent batch parallel scanning and sub agent dispatcher some of this stuff seems like it's very simple i could easily search megabytes worth of basically text files for the presence of certain indicators that would tell me if it had some other um liability liability in terms of code that I don't want in there or references to a link that I know caused me problems in the past so let me just make sure there's no other things that have it right so I scan and grep for that across all the files right that takes a couple milliseconds and then you know you can check it off that's how you do it and you can say at this time on this date I state your name scanned and didn't find any more of this so we can check that off and say it's done that's how you do a dev log so to be very easy to understand your actions and to prove your you did what you did this is all mind work it's invisible to people if you don't log it it doesn't get recorded if you don't log it then the developers work doesn't get recorded if we're not logging reasons for decisions that are being made for code changes and architecture decisions than we are liable for being questioned and potentially illegal action because the attempt to prove that we didn't do due diligence right the way you prove you did is by logging your actions that's why chain of custody is critical for litigation support for ITAT or sanitizing hard drives certifications for anything with HIPAA data it matters it has to be defensible in order to be defensible the logs have to be kept reliably without question they can never ever be not there just like you can never lose data multiple ways of snapshot or backup or off-site or what-not because anything could happen I have some local copies here but I'm saying once you've deployed out into the cloud a different way.
