Hyundai Workforce Management Requirements Debrief
Meeting Purpose
Debrief and align on key requirements for Hyundai's new workforce management system following client meeting.
Key Takeaways
•	Client prioritizes visibility into milestone-based professional services, managed services, and contractor tracking for compliance/audit
•	Time card integration and automated invoicing are critical pain points to address
•	SOW tracking needs improvement, especially for fixed-fee projects to justify change orders
•	System should centralize and streamline PO/invoicing process, reducing manual work
Topics
Contractor Management Requirements
•	Tracking needs: employee name, pay, PO funds remaining, location, job description, hiring manager
•	Expanded contractor profile: work location, assigned manager, equipment inventory
•	Critical for compliance/audit: knowing who's working on what projects
•	Additional data points: associated PO, spend, department/division, hours left on PO
•	Lower priority: equipment tracking, possible integration with asset management
Time Card & Invoicing Process
•	Current pain: Contractors log time in two systems (Hyundai's and Balance Staffing's)
•	Goal: Single time entry system with API to capture approvals and import into Balance Staffing's system
•	Ideal workflow: Contractor enters time in Hyundai system → Manager approves → Auto-import to Balance system → Auto-generate invoice → Upload to portal
•	Challenge: Some managers aren't consistently approving/releasing funds (GR process)
Purchase Order (PO) Process
•	Current steps: Manager creates PR → Procurement creates PO → Balance signs TPSC → PO issued → Invoices submitted → Manager creates GR
•	TPSC: Temporary Personnel Services Engagement
•	Pain point: POs often not issued before work starts
•	Inconsistent manager behavior in GR process causes extra manual work
Statement of Work (SOW) Tracking
•	Two types: Deliverables-based and Fixed-fee ("maintenance")
•	Fixed-fee example: Asset management for 6,500 employees (hardware lifecycle)
•	Need: Digitize agreed-upon terms, including total value
•	Track payments against total SOW value
•	Pain point: Change order process lacks visibility, leading to unexpected cost increases
•	Goal: Centralized system for change order requests, justifications, and approvals
System Goals
•	Improve process control and visibility
•	Enhance cost management for time & materials and milestone-based projects
•	Streamline and partly automate PO/invoicing workflow
•	Provide data-backed justification for SOW change orders
Next Steps
•	Design system architecture to address time card integration and automated invoicing
•	Develop centralized SOW tracking system with change order management
•	Create streamlined PO/invoicing process to reduce manual work
•	Plan phased approach, potentially addressing deliverables-based SOWs in phase two
•	Align on data sources and refine user interface requirements
