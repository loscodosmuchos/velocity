## **EXPANDED ROLE DEFINITIONS + DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK**

Based on your core job functions, Chaos to Control project files, HA-MVP requirements, and the user-anticipation philosophy from our previous conversation, here is a **comprehensive role expansion with game-changing discovery questions** designed to win any demo by proving you understand what users *really* need.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]

***

## **ENHANCED ROLE DEFINITIONS WITH DISCOVERY QUESTIONS**

### **1. Procurement Officer/Manager**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Creates, manages, and tracks purchase orders
- Vets and manages vendor relationships
- Ensures compliance and budget adherence

**Additional Context from Chaos to Control:**

- Currently dealing with **reactive vendor procurement** where \$500K+ gets spent on emergency contracts without competitive bidding[^4][^5]
- Lacks **visibility into contract terms**, SLAs, and vendor performance metrics
- Needs **AI-powered contract risk analysis** to prevent liability exposure[^2]


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Pain Point Mapping:**

- When you create a PO, **what vendor information do you desperately wish you had** but currently can't access? (e.g., past performance scores, contract violation history, comparable pricing from 3 other vendors?)
- **How much time do you waste** hunting down a single PO to answer "Where is this shipment?" or "Who approved this?"
- What's the **worst scenario** that has happened—PO created, then what went wrong? (e.g., unauthorized auto-renewal, unexpected cost overruns, vendor failed to deliver?)
- **How do you currently know** if a vendor delivered what you actually ordered vs. what was invoiced?

**Workflow Inefficiency:**

- Walk me through what happens when a **change order request** comes in. Who touches it? How many emails/calls/meetings does it take to get approval?
- **What triggers an emergency procurement situation**, and how much does that cost you in premium vendor rates?
- If you could **automatically flag risky contract terms** (auto-renewal, unlimited liability, payment > Net-60), would that change how fast you approve vendors?

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if, when you opened a PO, the system **instantly showed you**:
> - This vendor is 12% more expensive than 3 comparable alternatives
> - Their last 5 deliveries were an average of 8 days late
> - This contract has an auto-renewal clause in 90 days
> - Here's a pre-generated email to 3 better vendors with RFQ language
> **Would that fundamentally change how you work?**"

***

### **2. Project Manager**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Oversees project timelines, budgets, scope changes
- Manages contractors and subcontractors
- Approves change orders and scope adjustments
- Tracks deliverables and milestones

**Additional Context from Chaos to Control:**

- Managing **165 projects on a whiteboard** with no prioritization framework[^5][^4]
- **Resource conflicts create constant firefighting** because dependency mapping doesn't exist
- **CEO asked for "next critical project"** and leadership couldn't answer—catastrophic governance failure[^4]


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Portfolio Visibility Crisis:**

- If your CEO walked in right now and asked **"What are our top 5 most at-risk projects?"** how long would it take you to answer with confidence?
- **How many projects** do you manage where you don't know if they're actually on track because status updates are manual/stale?
- What's the **cost of a project delay** in your organization? (customer penalties, lost revenue, team morale?)

**Dependency Blindness:**

- Have you ever had a situation where **Project A blocked Project B**, but nobody knew until it was too late? What was the damage?
- **How do you currently track** which projects depend on which resources, vendors, or other projects?
- If I told you **"Your Active Directory team being overloaded will delay 6 downstream projects,"** how valuable would that insight be *30 days before* it happens?

**Resource Allocation:**

- **How much time do you spend** manually forecasting whether you have enough people/skills for next quarter's projects?
- Walk me through what happens when a **critical resource goes on PTO** or gets pulled to a fire-drill. How do you rebalance the portfolio?

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if the system **automatically told you**:
> - Resource conflict detected: Mark is assigned 160% capacity in Q2
> - Project Red depends on Active Directory upgrade (currently 3 weeks behind)
> - If you delay Project Blue by 2 weeks, you unlock Mark for Project Red's critical path
> - Here's a one-click email to stakeholders explaining the re-prioritization with data-driven justification
> **Would you trust the system to make these calls for you?**"

***

### **3. Facility/Operations Manager**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Manages physical assets and equipment
- Tracks maintenance schedules
- Assigns assets to projects/employees/facilities
- Monitors asset utilization and condition

**Additional Context from Chaos to Control:**

- **Every network switch is end-of-life**, discovered only during a power outage when staff were buying replacements on eBay in panic mode[^4]
- **No dependency documentation** exists—upgrading switches kills connectivity at 19 remote sites[^4]


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Asset Location Crisis:**

- **How do you know where a specific asset is RIGHT NOW?** (not where it should be, where it actually is)
- What's the **cost of a missing or misplaced** piece of critical equipment? (project delays, emergency replacements, employee downtime?)
- When something breaks, **how do you determine** if it's due for maintenance vs. user damage vs. end-of-life?

**Maintenance Blind Spots:**

- **How much time is wasted** looking for "the right tool" or compatible equipment for a job?
- What **percentage of your equipment failures** could have been prevented if you had predictive maintenance alerts?
- Walk me through what happens when an asset **goes off-warranty**. Who decides: repair, replace, or retire? How long does that take?

**Deployment Inefficiency:**

- When a new employee starts, **how do you know** which asset to assign them? (compatibility with their team's setup, availability, condition?)
- **How many assets** are sitting unused in storage that could be redeployed instead of buying new?

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if, when you looked at an asset record, the system showed you:
> - This laptop was assigned to Jane (Engineering), deployed to Building B, Desk 12
> - Warranty expires in 47 days—here's the pre-approved budget line for replacement
> - 3 compatible devices are available in surplus from departing employees
> - Maintenance history shows this model has a 40% failure rate at 18 months—recommend early replacement
> - One-click: generate e-waste certificate, assign surplus device to new hire, update inventory
> **Would this eliminate your emergency procurement scenarios?**"

***

### **4. Finance/Accounting Manager**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Processes and approves invoices
- Reconciles expenses and variances
- Manages vendor payments
- Budget forecasting and analysis


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Approval Bottlenecks:**

- **How many back-and-forths** happen before an expense gets approved? What's the longest it's taken?
- What **percentage of invoices** have discrepancies that require manual investigation?
- **How do you currently know** if an expense violates policy before it's already been incurred?

**Budget Variance Surprises:**

- Walk me through a time when a **budget overrun blindsided you**. What could have prevented it?
- **How often do you reconcile** actual spend vs. budget? What happens when you find variances?
- **What information do you wish you had** when approving a large invoice? (historical spend with this vendor, contract terms, budget remaining?)

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if every invoice automatically showed:
> - This is 15% over the contracted rate—flagged for review
> - This vendor has been paid \$240K YTD vs. \$180K budgeted
> - Policy violation: expense requires VP approval but was routed to Director
> - Recommended action: hold payment pending contract review
> **Would this make expense management feel FAST and trustworthy?**"

***

### **5. HR Manager/Recruiter**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Manages employee records and onboarding
- Recruits and vets contractors
- Tracks workforce capacity
- Performance management


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Contractor Vetting Gap:**

- **How do you know** a contractor is the right fit *before* they're 3 months into a project?
- What **percentage of contractor hires** don't work out, and what does replacing them cost?
- Walk me through how you currently track **contractor performance** across multiple projects.

**Capacity Blindness:**

- **How do you forecast** whether you have enough people with the right skills for next quarter?
- What happens when a **critical skillset** isn't available internally? How long does it take to backfill?

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if the system showed:
> - Skill gap detected: need 2 Python devs in Q2, none available internally
> - Recommended contractors: 5 pre-vetted options from preferred staffing partners
> - Historical performance: Contractor A delivered 93% on-time on 4 past projects
> - Auto-draft job req and post to 3 staffing agencies
> **Would this eliminate last-minute contractor premiums?**"

***

### **6. Field Manager/Supervisor**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Approves timecards and daily hours
- Manages team assignments and workload
- Approves employee/contractor expenses
- Handles daily operational issues


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Timecard Disputes:**

- **How much time** do you spend reconciling disputed hours each pay period?
- What **context is missing** that makes it hard to verify whether logged hours are accurate?
- **How many times** have payroll errors happened because timecard data was wrong?

**Workload Imbalance:**

- **How do you know** if one team member is overloaded while another is underutilized?
- What happens when someone **calls out sick**—how do you re-assign their work?

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if timecards automatically showed:
> - John logged 12 hours yesterday but project notes show site was closed for weather
> - Mary's average hours are trending 20% below team—check in?
> - This expense requires photo receipt per policy—auto-request before approval
> **Would this make timecard approval something you could do in 10 minutes instead of 2 hours?**"

***

### **7. Payroll Administrator**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Processes timecards for payment
- Resolves timecard disputes
- Ensures accurate compensation
- Compliance with labor laws


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Dispute Resolution:**

- **What percentage** of timecards require manual correction each cycle?
- Walk me through a timecard dispute that took **multiple days to resolve**. What information was missing?
- **How do you ensure** compliance with overtime rules, break requirements, and local labor laws?

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if the system:
> - Auto-validated timecards against project schedules, PTO calendars, and labor rules
> - Flagged: 'Sarah logged 50 hours but no overtime pre-approval—hold payment'
> - One-click: request clarification from manager, pause payment, log audit trail
> **Would this eliminate payroll errors and compliance risks?**"

***

### **8. Executive/C-Suite Leadership**

**Core Responsibilities:**

- Views strategic dashboards
- Approves high-value contracts/changes
- Reviews business metrics and ROI
- Makes strategic vendor/contractor decisions


#### **Discovery Questions:**

**Strategic Blind Spots:**

- **How confident are you** that the project portfolio aligns with strategic priorities?
- What's an example of a time you **couldn't answer a board question** because the data didn't exist or was too scattered?
- **How much time do you spend** in meetings where people are hunting for information instead of making decisions?

**Wow Factor Opportunity:**
> "What if you had a dashboard that answered:
> - Top 5 projects by ROI vs. strategic alignment
> - \$2.3M at risk across 12 projects—here's why and what to do
> - Vendor spend trending 18% over budget—auto-generated renegotiation playbook
> **Would you ever need another status meeting?**"

***

### **ADDITIONAL CRITICAL ROLES TO ADD**

#### **9. Compliance/Risk Manager** *(NEW)*

**Why Add:** Procurement and contractor management have massive compliance exposure (GDPR, SOC2, insurance, labor law)

**Discovery Questions:**

- **How do you currently track** which vendors have current insurance certificates, background checks, compliance certifications?
- Walk me through a time when a **compliance failure cost you** (audit finding, contract breach, regulatory fine)
- **What keeps you up at night** about vendor or contractor compliance?

**Wow Factor:**
> "Auto-alert: Vendor X's insurance expires in 30 days—contract requires 60-day renewal notice. Draft termination notice or renewal request?"

***

#### **10. IT/Systems Administrator** *(NEW)*

**Why Add:** They manage the infrastructure that supports all these workflows

**Discovery Questions:**

- **How many systems** do procurement, PM, HR, and finance teams currently use? How many don't talk to each other?
- Walk me through what happens when someone requests a **new integration**. How long does it take?
- **What's the biggest tech debt** problem you're managing right now?

**Wow Factor:**
> "Pre-built connectors for Jira, Salesforce, NetSuite, ADP—15-minute setup, zero custom code. Would that change your world?"

***

## **NEXT STEPS: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **For Each Role:**

1. **Conduct 3-5 discovery interviews** using these questions
2. **Document "I wish I could..." statements** verbatim—these become feature specs
3. **Map pain points to Velocity features** using the 6-criteria framework from our earlier conversation
4. **Build role-specific demo flows** that show "before Velocity" vs. "after Velocity" using their actual language

### **Competitive Advantage:**

When you walk into a demo and say:
> "We interviewed 47 procurement managers, and 89% said their \#1 pain point was reactive vendor procurement driving costs up 30-50%. Here's how we solve that..."

**You've already won** because you proved you understand their world better than they do.[^3][^6][^1][^2][^5][^4]
