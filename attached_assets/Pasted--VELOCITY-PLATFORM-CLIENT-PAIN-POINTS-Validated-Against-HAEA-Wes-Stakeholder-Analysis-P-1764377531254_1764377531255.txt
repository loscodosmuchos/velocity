# VELOCITY PLATFORM: CLIENT PAIN POINTS
## Validated Against HAEA/Wes Stakeholder Analysis

### Project Manager (Ben/Mark - HAEA)
• Managing 165+ projects on whiteboard with zero visibility
• Can't answer "top 5 at-risk projects" without 2-hour PowerPoint
• Resource conflicts discovered too late (e.g., Emily on 3 simultaneous projects)
• Dependency blindness: AD upgrade blocks 6 downstream projects worth $2.3M+
• 15+ hours/week administrative burden on manual status reporting

### Chief Procurement Officer (Wesley - HAEA)
• Vendor crises escalate unexpectedly (E-Plus $500K for 3-week project)
• Reactive procurement eliminates negotiation power - no competitive bidding
• SOW automation takes 30+ days → loses competitive agility
• Contract renewals sneak up → forced into unfavorable terms
• No visibility into vendor performance across 165+ projects

### VMS Director
• Bad contractor hire = 3+ months wasted + project delays + reputation damage
• Can't track contractor performance across projects
• End-of-engagement discovered at last minute (forces 60-90 day scramble)
• Overpaying contractors 15-30% with no rate benchmarking
• Last-minute "need someone now" requests drive premium pricing

### Finance Controller
• Budget surprises at month-end instead of real-time alerts
• Invoice errors caught AFTER payment (no recovery process)
• Vendor cost creep undetected until annual review
• Manual reconciliation: 15+ hours/week per PM across org
• No forecasting capability - always reactive

### IT Director
• Integration hell: 15-20 fragmented tools with no single source of truth
• EOL surprises during crises (HQ switches purchased on eBay during power outage)
• Change impact blindness: Single switch upgrade affects 19 sites without warning
• No network documentation - every outage is a "learning experience"
• Custom integrations consume 60%+ of dev capacity (estimated)

### Executive Leadership (CEO Paul - HAEA)
• Can't answer board questions about portfolio health
• "What's our next critical project?" → No answer available
• Strategic decisions made on gut feel, not data
• Recurring embarrassment at leadership meetings
• No visibility into $3.1M+ annual waste from reactive operations
