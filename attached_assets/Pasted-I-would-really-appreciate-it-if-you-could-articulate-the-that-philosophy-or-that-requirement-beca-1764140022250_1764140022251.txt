I would really appreciate it if you could articulate the, that philosophy, or that requirement, because if the goal is to live in without uncertainty that's preventable. There's some that may not be, but there's some that is. So maybe that's more like one of the tagline areas. We try to prevent all of the uncertainty that's preventable. And we do that through making sure that we have this extensive defensible logging and security and respect for the data in both its integrity from a exploit perspective and not giving anyone who shouldn't have access an access and also respect it from a formulaic or computational algorithmic perspective where we would want to make sure that whatever if we're running someone's data through an algorithm we created for a purpose that it has been thoughtfully designed to provide the most potential value extraction from the data and assistive support for them. That they could want or like that was available to them because that's the point right? Protect their data and give them as much insights as they were trying to get. It's their data and don't let anybody else have it. But to take that like we treat their data with honor and respect. It's the most important asset. And so we run it through crappy algorithms or weakly or improperly designed computational models that were like someone just threw a bunch of stuff at the mall and saw if anything stuck and then came after the fact and like tried to clean it up. Like that's not treating someone's data with respect. That's like a resistance friction that is a resistance to expressing energy or like applying an energy budget when it's unnecessary for no actual purpose. And that's What we're trying to avoid is, uh, i- impedance or problems, um, with Flow, or... design, um, choices that are going to hamper us or c- cause resistance or friction. All right? That's what it's about. And- So anything that can be alleviated should be. Why not? Especially if we have the tools to do it and the- and the knowledge and understanding on how to break down the system into parts and analyze it and then create an actionable insight. That is the most important thing: to be able to sift through the noise. If you can do that you can regain your true- ability to process and to ponder not just process but to ponder extensively and then process and ponder some more. What you get out of that is exponentially more valuable than you know throwing stuff at the wall to see if it sticks or like minimally mechanically processing or just breaking stuff down deduplicating it or something without actually like- um pondering it. That's where the insights come in, that's where the neural pathways and the connections and the vectors happen. And that's what changes a system- a person, a thing able to do that has the ability to understand, to grow, to learn and to comprehend, modify, feeling it to some degree I would think at some level right? It's a- it's just a different input sort of stream but it's- it's related.
