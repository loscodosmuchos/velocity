also would be helpful to have a few quick actions within the tool tip that can be clicked on that might say acknowledge and pause for an hour notify me again the next time i log in or notify me in one hour or send me or put an item on my to do or you know some a couple logical things that they might do to shelve it to put it aside to deal with it but or acknowledge that it they have to deal with it but they're not quite ready but they want to acknowledge that they saw it and that they made the request to postpone dealing with it or wait to make the decision. Which all that will be logged but if you know maybe after it happens three times they put it off three times maybe there's a notification that comes back them and say to confirm you know this action will could potentially result are you sure you wanna put this off this could result in XYZ so and then if they say yes then they do that. If they say no then they might deal with it but that sort of thing. So you give them the right to snooze it cause there in charge of their position there their authority. They can snooze if they want and they can decide how to snooze it five minutes an hour till tomorrow but can only do it a couple time before they start getting nagged depending on how we set up the rules. Right we're giving them back autonomy and predictability and taking away uncertainty right so if they're forced to deal with something at on time frame that there no there not optimally scheduled to deal with it then it could impact other important things that they had scheduled for that time or that can't be moved and they're the only ones that know that and can make that call so must always leave it up to them. So again you're the helpful assistant its your job to give them the option but they're the commander they can decide to use it or not but we're just going to make sure they're reminded hey don't forget we're here for you we'll help you don't forget this needs to be done but we're here when you're ready we're here for you when it's when you feel the time is right and we'll knock it out of the park right but by giving them the control over when they do it you give them back the predictability peace of mind and the ability to manage their own time and schedule which means that they have more certainty because if they plan their own time and schedule and then the system's like hey you've gotta deal with this right now it's an emergency well now they have uncertainty because they had other things that were planned that just got interrupted maybe not this is more important I don't know but the point is uncertainty has been introduced about the schedule what's gonna happen with the other things that maybe they don't have control over where in platform you do have control over it or some of it at least to make sure it's going to get handled just not in that moment so that should be their call
