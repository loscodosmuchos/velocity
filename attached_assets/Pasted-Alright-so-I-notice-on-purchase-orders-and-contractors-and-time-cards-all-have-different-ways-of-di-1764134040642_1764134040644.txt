Alright, so I notice on purchase orders and contractors and time cards all have different ways of displaying spreadsheet-type data. And I notice we're going to have to go through every single one of these pages with the legendary lens and the architect because the contractors or excuse me the time cards page the contractor in PO columns have dark blue text on medium blue background or black. I think it needs to have more contrast there and more excuse me less saturation on the status button which are bright red. They're kind of hard to even look at. They're so bright. That's the time cards. To create a time card, there needs to be an upload time card right? We have a time card processor AI agent that needs to be integrated into right here. So it's create or upload and have it automatically analyzed and imported. Show a workflow: upload time card arrow over to review data (interpreted, parsed, whatever). The user reviews the data, approves it. So they know once I upload it, I'll get to see it and then I get to approve it. So I'm not going to upload it and then it will automatically go in and I don't know what it saw. These are important to alleviate their concerns. The workflow there and then we just put in the AI bot. I can give you the APIs for Claude, which is what we're going to be using for this. And this script for the contractor analyzer. I have the modules and everything already done, at least if I can find them right now. And I'll add them just going on a list. The invoices are the same color scheme, although it looks like the payment status buttons are cut off and you're missing a few letters on the overdue button. The invoice detail and I would imagine other detail pages need to be luxurified. Not over the top, but this one is all right, it just has no variance in color, icons, contrast, or any differentiation. It needs to have something that is helping the user, guiding the user on what options they can do here or what they might want to know. We're supposed to be predictably analyzing the user's wants and needs before they even know them. What do they want to do here? How can we help them? How can we help them find it faster? Color icons for thought design architect. Also check for any nan errors because there are two of them on this page for the insight (for the invoice show). Must have a time card parser. If you need the code, I can give it to you. It means literally just upload, scan, OCR, and report results, reformat in a time card format as they were read in and as you propose importing them and then look up to make sure you can find the employee they're referring to and note that as well. That way, you know that you have a place to put it and then it will go there if they approve it. So that you know they don't approve it and then you say "oh sorry, they don't exist on the system". That would be foolish and unnecessary.
