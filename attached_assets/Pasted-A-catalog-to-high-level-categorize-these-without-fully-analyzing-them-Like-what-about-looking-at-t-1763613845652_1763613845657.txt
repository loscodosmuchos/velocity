A catalog, to high level categorize these without fully analyzing them. Like what about looking at the titles and if you can't figure out from the title, grab the first chunk of a few hundred characters, classify that, and then decide is that possible? Is that a strategy?Now that they've been categorized into groups, can you take the smallest group with the least amount of files and analyze it through the lens to capture maximum insights and innovative features and methods and stuff, structures, links, contexts. And so derive the prompt to be able to optimally capture everything that's going to be in there in that format in a way that is the most useful. So as you're doing it create the prompt and performing the function on the version with the least amount of actual data files so we can evaluate the performance before proceeding.To set the context here we are trying to find best practices for the ATS/VMS/HRIS and the other categories. The industry experts that have decades of experience and those insights we are capturing those with the intent to integrate them into the specifications for the new application that we have built to ensure completeness due diligence that it contains all of the features and functions that it needs to and that would be expected of an enterprise class application of this type and that we are hitting all of the points that we need to the major pain points on the MVP list for the demo for the client and that we haven't missed anything we were including everything that the advice when turned into actionable insights can be directly applied and tested and put into practice they're not just words they're actually words that can be directly translated into benefits and are clear to how that would occur and why and then ranked And then if you could prepare zip files individually for each section category of files and in the zip file put the text file that contains the version of this optimized prompt that you're creating now for that particular category. So it should be zip file The files for the category and the description of the prompt for that category and any other metadata that we might need but that's probably all.  and these inside extraction prompts should really be geared towards this format of a transcript. So for podcasts, for videos describing new technologies, new features, walk-throughs of interfaces or functionality within existing applications, announcements, conference presentations. Really anything like that.so if after reviewing all of these files you have additional insights that only occurred once the totality had been ingested processed and pondered and you start recognizing patterns and things that you didn't recognize at the beginning new awarenesses and aha moments and insights that only arrived and were noted upon the full ingestion of all of the data and its synergies having been noted reveal these insights and you want to share them so put them in a different section as well in another file things you see that you didn't see before new awarenesses noteworthy things unexpected connections that sort of thing And also make a note to note that after every processing of documents, that exact prompt, the additional insights, and append that to another file or to the bottom of one of the other metadata files within that group of files. That should be part of the instruction set because those are valuable.
