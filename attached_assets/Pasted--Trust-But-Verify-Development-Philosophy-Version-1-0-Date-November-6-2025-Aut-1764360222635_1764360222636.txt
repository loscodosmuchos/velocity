# Trust But Verify - Development Philosophy
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Authors:** Human + AI Collaboration  
**Status:** Active Core Principle  
**Purpose:** Define the trust-building approach that ensures quality through verification

---

## The Core Principle

> **"Trust each other, verify firsthand with screenshots."**

**Meaning:** Trust is built through verification, not blind faith.

---

## The Philosophy Unpacked

### Trust Each Other

**What it means:**
- Assume good intentions
- Believe collaborators are competent
- Give autonomy and responsibility
- Don't micromanage or second-guess

**What it doesn't mean:**
- Accept claims without evidence
- Skip verification steps
- Ignore potential issues
- Assume perfection

**Balance:** Trust people's abilities + Verify the results

---

### Verify Firsthand

**What it means:**
- See it working yourself
- Test with real data/scenarios
- Capture evidence (screenshots, logs)
- Don't just take someone's word for it

**What it doesn't mean:**
- Distrust or suspicion
- Constant oversight
- Micromanagement
- Lack of confidence in team

**Balance:** Verification builds confidence, not undermines it

---

### With Screenshots

**Why screenshots?**
1. **Visual proof** - Can't argue with what's visible
2. **Shared understanding** - Everyone sees the same thing
3. **Documentation** - Evidence preserved for later
4. **Debugging aid** - Reveals issues not caught in description

**What else counts as "screenshots"?**
- Actual screenshots (images of UI)
- Console logs (text evidence)
- Curl output (API evidence)
- SQL query results (database evidence)
- Error messages (failure evidence)

**Principle:** Provide concrete evidence, not just descriptions

---

## Why This Philosophy Matters

### The Problem: Miscommunication

**Scenario:**
```
AI: "I fixed the batch indicator bug"
Human: "Great! Deploying to production"
[Production] Users: "I don't see any batch indicator"
Reality: AI fixed wrong file, or fix didn't apply
Result: Broken production, lost trust
```

**What went wrong:** No verification step

### The Solution: Trust But Verify

**Scenario:**
```
AI: "I fixed the batch indicator bug"
AI: *Provides screenshot showing indicator in header*
AI: *Shows browser console with no errors*
AI: *Shares code diff confirming changes*
Human: "Perfect, I can see it working. Deploying."
[Production] Works as expected
Result: Confident deployment, trust reinforced
```

**What went right:** Verification before deployment

---

## Levels of Verification

### Level 1: Self-Verification (Minimum)

**Before claiming something works:**
```
□ Tested it yourself
□ Saw it working with your own eyes
□ Checked for edge cases
□ No errors in console/logs
```

**Example:**
```
❌ "The API should return user data now"
✓ "The API returns user data - here's curl output showing it"
```

### Level 2: Evidence-Based (Standard)

**Provide concrete evidence:**
```
□ Screenshot of working feature
□ Console logs showing no errors
□ API response showing correct data
□ Database query confirming state
```

**Example:**
```
❌ "Login works"
✓ "Login works - screenshot shows dashboard after login, console has no errors, session token in cookies"
```

### Level 3: Multi-Angle (Thorough)

**Verify from multiple perspectives:**
```
□ Self-test with evidence
□ Tested on different browser/device
□ Tested with different user roles
□ Tested edge cases
□ Checked database state
□ Reviewed code changes
```

**Example:**
```
❌ "Batch feature complete"
✓ "Batch feature complete - tested on Chrome/Firefox, works for new and existing users, handles empty batches, screenshots show each step, database has correct schema, code reviewed and defensive"
```

---

## Application to Development Workflow

### Before Claiming "Done"

**Checklist:**
```
1. Feature implemented ✓
2. Tested locally ✓
3. No console errors ✓
4. Screenshot captured ✓
5. Edge cases checked ✓
6. Evidence documented ✓
7. THEN claim done
```

### During Code Review

**Reviewer perspective:**
```
Trust: Developer implemented feature
Verify: 
  - Review code changes
  - Check screenshot evidence
  - Test locally if critical
  - Ask questions if unclear
```

**Developer perspective:**
```
Trust: Reviewer understands goals
Verify:
  - Provide clear screenshots
  - Show evidence it works
  - Document test cases
  - Address feedback
```

### During Debugging

**When reporting bugs:**
```
❌ "It's broken"
✓ "Here's what's broken:
   - Screenshot showing error
   - Console log with stack trace
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior"
```

**When claiming bug fixed:**
```
❌ "Fixed it"
✓ "Fixed - here's evidence:
   - Screenshot showing it works now
   - Console clean (no errors)
   - Tested edge cases
   - Code diff showing fix"
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Batch Indicator Feature

**Before Trust But Verify:**
```
AI: "Added batch indicator to header"
Human: "Great!"
[Later] Human: "I don't see it anywhere"
Problem: Feature was partially implemented
```

**After Trust But Verify:**
```
AI: "Added batch indicator to header"
AI: *Screenshot showing indicator in global header*
AI: *Screenshot showing indicator on Analyze page*
AI: *Console logs showing no errors*
AI: *Code diff confirming changes*
Human: "Perfect, I can see it in both places. Approved!"
```

**Result:** Clear understanding, no surprises

### Example 2: Cancel Batch Fix

**Before Trust But Verify:**
```
AI: "Wired cancel batch to backend"
Human: "Good"
[Architect Review] "Not wired, frontend only"
Problem: Claim was premature
```

**After Trust But Verify:**
```
AI: "Wired cancel batch to backend:
   - Added PATCH /api/batches/:id/cancel route
   - Frontend mutation calls backend
   - Tested with curl: [output showing 200 OK]
   - Backend marks batch as cancelled in DB
   - Screenshot of completed flow"
Human: "Excellent, I can see the full implementation"
```

**Result:** Architect review passed, feature complete

## Building Trust Through Verification

### Paradox: Verification Increases Trust

**Counterintuitive:** You might think verification shows distrust

**Reality:** Verification builds confidence

**Why?**
1. **Transparency** - Nothing hidden, everything visible
2. **Accountability** - Can't claim something works without proof
3. **Quality** - Forces self-verification before claiming done
4. **Communication** - Evidence is clearer than descriptions

**Outcome:** Trust grows because verification catches issues early

### The Trust Ladder

**Level 1: No Trust**
```
Human: "Did you fix it?"
AI: "Yes"
Human: "Let me test every line of code myself"
```
(Exhausting, slow, inefficient)

**Level 2: Blind Trust**
```
Human: "Did you fix it?"
AI: "Yes"
Human: "OK, deploying"
```
(Risky, breaks often, erodes trust)

**Level 3: Trust But Verify**
```
Human: "Did you fix it?"
AI: "Yes - here's evidence [screenshots]"
Human: "I can see it working, deploying"
```
(Fast, confident, trust reinforced)

**Sweet spot:** Level 3

## What Counts as Verification?

### Good Verification Evidence

✅ **Screenshots**
- Shows actual UI state
- Captures visual bugs
- Proves feature exists
- Shows user perspective

✅ **Console Logs**
- Proves no errors
- Shows correct data flow
- Captures API responses
- Reveals timing issues

✅ **Curl/API Output**
- Proves endpoint works
- Shows correct status codes
- Displays actual responses
- Tests without UI

✅ **Database Queries**
- Proves data persisted
- Shows correct state
- Validates migrations
- Tests edge cases

✅ **Code Diffs**
- Shows what changed
- Proves fix applied
- Enables code review
- Documents evolution

### Poor Verification Evidence

❌ **"It works"** (No evidence)

❌ **"Should work"** (Not tested)

❌ **"Probably works"** (Uncertain)

❌ **"Worked yesterday"** (Stale)

❌ **"Works on my machine"** (Not portable)

## Integration with Other Philosophies

### Trust But Verify + Multi-Angle Verification

**Synergy:**
- Trust: Feature implemented
- Verify (Angle 1): Code looks correct
- Verify (Angle 2): API tested
- Verify (Angle 3): Database checked
- Verify (Angle 4): Browser console clean
- Verify (Angle 5): Edge cases handled

**Result:** Deep confidence through comprehensive verification

### Trust But Verify + Journey-Based UX

**Synergy:**
- Trust: UX is good
- Verify: Walk through user journey
- Verify: Screenshot each step
- Verify: Check sentiment at each step
- Verify: Identify gaps with evidence

**Result:** UX claims backed by real user perspective

### Trust But Verify + Documentation

**Synergy:**
- Trust: Insights are valuable
- Verify: Document with examples
- Verify: Include code artifacts
- Verify: Link to actual implementations
- Verify: Test that patterns work

**Result:** Documentation is trustworthy and actionable

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Verification as Bureaucracy

**Wrong mindset:** "Ugh, I have to provide screenshots again"

**Right mindset:** "Screenshots catch issues before deployment"

**Reality:** 2 minutes of verification saves hours of debugging

### Pitfall 2: Fake Evidence

**Wrong approach:** Doctored screenshots, cherry-picked logs

**Right approach:** Real evidence from actual testing

**Reality:** Fake evidence destroys trust instantly and completely

### Pitfall 3: Over-Verification

**Wrong balance:** Test every trivial change 10 different ways

**Right balance:** Proportional verification (critical = thorough, trivial = quick)

**Reality:** Verification should match severity

### Pitfall 4: Verification Without Trust

**Wrong attitude:** "Prove it because I don't believe you"

**Right attitude:** "Show me so we can both be confident"

**Reality:** Verification should build trust, not reflect its absence
