# DEVIATION DETECTION - Am I Off the Path?
## "The Intervention Protocol"

---

## **🎯 THE PROBLEM**

When you're on the **wrong path**, it often feels like the **right path**.

You've dropped the disks (forgotten the frameworks). You're building fast, shipping features... but:
- ❌ Features work but don't deliver complete workflows
- ❌ UI looks great but has no end-to-end validation
- ❌ Code ships but hasn't been tested manually
- ❌ Tasks close but architect finds critical gaps

**You've deviated from the path. But you didn't notice.**

---

## **🚨 DEVIATION SIGNALS - The Warning Signs**

### **Signal 1: Skipping Checklists**
**What it looks like**:
- "I'll just quickly add this feature..."
- "No need to document, it's simple..."
- "I'll test it later..."

**What it means**: You're prioritizing speed over quality. Path deviation.

**Intervention**: Stop. Open CRITICAL_WORKFLOWS.md. Follow the checklist.

---

### **Signal 2: Architect Catches Issues**
**What it looks like**:
- Architect review finds missing workflows
- "This doesn't have end-to-end completion"
- "Success state is missing"
- "No validation criteria defined"

**What it means**: You shipped without framework validation. Path deviation.

**Intervention**: Review FUNCTIONAL_AUDIT_FRAMEWORK before next feature.

---

### **Signal 3: User Confusion**
**What it looks like**:
- Users ask "where's my report?"
- "Did it work?"
- "What do I do next?"

**What it means**: You built UI without complete workflow. Path deviation.

**Intervention**: Read LESSONS_LEARNED/L001 (Function Before Form).

---

### **Signal 4: Repeated Bugs**
**What it looks like**:
- Same type of bug appears in multiple features
- "Didn't we fix this before?"
- Database migrations keep breaking

**What it means**: You're not documenting/applying lessons. Path deviation.

**Intervention**: Search LESSONS_LEARNED for pattern, or create new entry.

---

### **Signal 5: "I Don't Have Time"**
**What it looks like**:
- "No time to write documentation"
- "Need to ship fast, will test later"
- "Framework is too slow"

**What it means**: You've forgotten WHY frameworks exist. Critical path deviation.

**Intervention**: You're about to waste MORE time fixing broken workflows. Stop. Review golden rules in replit.md.

## **📊 DEVIATION SELF-CHECK**

Run this quick assessment when you feel unsure:

### **Am I On The Path?**

- [ ] Did I check DAILY_STANDUP.md this morning?
- [ ] Did I follow the relevant framework checklist?
- [ ] Can I answer WHAT/WHY/WHO/HOW/VALIDATION for my current work?
- [ ] Have I tested the complete workflow manually?
- [ ] Did I document any new patterns discovered?
- [ ] Will architect review confirm this meets criteria?

**Score**:
- **6/6**: ✅ On the path. Keep going.
- **4-5/6**: ⚠️ Minor deviation. Course-correct now.
- **0-3/6**: 🚨 Major deviation. STOP. Review frameworks.

---

## **🔄 THE INTERVENTION PROTOCOL**

### **Step 1: STOP**
Stop coding. Stop shipping. Stop rushing.

### **Step 2: IDENTIFY**
Which signal(s) am I seeing?
- Skipped checklists?
- Architect feedback?
- User confusion?
- Repeated bugs?
- Time pressure excuse?

### **Step 3: REVIEW**
Open the relevant framework:
- CRITICAL_WORKFLOWS.md (general)
- FUNCTIONAL_AUDIT_FRAMEWORK.md (feature validation)
- LESSONS_LEARNED/INDEX.md (known patterns)
- DAILY_STANDUP.md (reset context)

### **Step 4: COURSE-CORRECT**
What did I miss? Apply it now:
- Missing end-to-end test? → Test manually
- No success dialog? → Add it
- Skipped validation? → Define PASS/FAIL criteria
- Forgot to document? → Add to LESSONS_LEARNED

### **Step 5: PREVENT**
How do I avoid this next time?
- Set calendar reminder for DAILY_STANDUP?
- Add framework link to task template?
- Schedule weekly LESSONS_LEARNED review?

## **💡 THE DISK STACKING METAPHOR**

Imagine learning as **stacking disks**:
- Each lesson learned = one disk stacked
- Following frameworks = keeping disks stable
- Skipping steps = dropping disks
- Path deviation = wobbly stack about to collapse

**When you notice disks dropping**:
1. Someone who knows you well will notice first (architect review)
2. They'll intervene ("you used to do X, now you don't")
3. You'll be reminded of lessons you already learned
4. You'll re-stack the disks (follow frameworks again)
5. Stability returns (quality improves, speed increases)

**The goal**: Stack so many disks that deviation becomes OBVIOUS to you FIRST, before others notice.

## **📈 FROM INTERVENTION TO PREVENTION**

### **Week 1-2: Manual Intervention**
- You forget frameworks regularly
- Architect catches issues
- Frequent course-corrections

### **Week 3-4: Self-Intervention**
- You start noticing deviation yourself
- "Wait, did I check the framework?"
- Fewer architect surprises

### **Week 5-8: Automatic Adherence**
- Frameworks become muscle memory
- Skipping steps feels WRONG
- Quality is your default

### **Week 9+: Compounding Bounty**
- You build faster BECAUSE of frameworks
- Fewer bugs, clearer workflows
- You're teaching others the patterns

---

## **🎯 REMEMBER**

**The path that feels fastest (skip frameworks) is actually slowest (fix broken workflows later).**

**The path that feels slowest (follow frameworks) is actually fastest (ship working features first time).**

**Deviation is subtle. Prevention is intentional.**

**Check the frameworks. Stack the disks. Stay on the path.**
