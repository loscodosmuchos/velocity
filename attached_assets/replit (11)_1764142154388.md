# Recruitment Platform with Dashboard Builder & GitHub Automation

## Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive web application with two primary features: a **Dashboard Builder Platform** and a **GitHub File Push Automation** tool. The core focus is the Dashboard Builder, a three-tier system enabling recruitment teams, executives, and vendor managers to create customizable analytics dashboards. These dashboards offer real-time KPI tracking, hiring funnel visualization, vendor metrics, and more, all supported by drag-and-drop functionality, role-based templates, and a dynamic theme engine. The GitHub automation serves as a tool for programmatically pushing files to GitHub repositories.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) v5
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui (New York style)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Dashboard Grid**: `react-grid-layout` for drag-and-drop customization.
- **Design Decisions**: Three-tier dashboard architecture (Module Catalog → Templates → User Overrides), card-based layouts, status-driven UI, progressive disclosure, custom fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono), real-time layout preview.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Build Tool**: Vite (frontend), esbuild (backend)
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs for dashboard management (modules, templates, layouts, themes) and GitHub automation.
- **Service Layer**: `DashboardService` and `ThemeService` for business logic, with Zod for request validation.

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, using Neon Database serverless driver.
- **Schema**: Seven tables for the dashboard system (`dashboard_modules`, `dashboard_templates`, `user_dashboard_layouts`, `theme_tokens`, `layout_items`, `module_categories`, `user_preferences`).
- **Seeded Data**: 37 modules across 7 categories, 8 role-based templates, and 3 themes (Modern Professional, Dark Executive, Warm Recruiter).
- **GitHub System**: In-memory storage using `MemStorage` class (non-persistent).

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Three-Tier Dashboard System**: Module Catalog, Layout Templates, User Overrides.
- **Hybrid State Management**: PostgreSQL for persistence, React Query for client-side caching, planned WebSocket for real-time.
- **Theme Engine**: CSS custom properties for dynamic theming, design tokens stored in DB, real-time switching.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Designed for extensibility with custom widgets, templates, and themes.
- **Shared Type System**: Common types and Zod schemas in `shared/schema.ts` for end-to-end type safety.
- **Monorepo Structure**: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/` directories.

## External Dependencies

- **Core Libraries**: `react-grid-layout`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `drizzle-orm`, `zod`.
- **GitHub Integration**: `@octokit/rest` v22 for GitHub API, OAuth via Replit Connectors API.
- **UI Libraries**: Radix UI, Lucide React, Tailwind CSS, `class-variance-authority`.
- **Development Tools**: Replit-specific Vite plugins, PostCSS, TypeScript.
