Alright let's take a list of requirements for the next demo, for Wes, and procurement. We need to have a concise, clear MVP list with KPIs associated We need to have a concise, clear MVP list with KPI's associated that make it obvious that we understand the nature of the problem and his specific challenges from procurement's perspective. We want to be clear that we can differentiate between his specific procurement related needs and what that dashboard may look like and what he may care about at a higher level of intensity than somebody else who is not in that position maybe a project manager, an engineering manager, IT facilities, shipping, whatever. They're obviously going to have different dashboards, because they are responsible for different things so the priority list, the hierarchy of their attention is different. So we want to be clear that we understand that by defining articulating the differences clearly and having them be front and center and to show how they informed our choices as it relates to the functionality prioritization the work flow display of the available capability capabilities and the flow and method and style of the procedure workflow or otherwise process to achieve one of the typical or standard or common tasks that that position needs to be successful in. And then breaking down that task into sub tasks or into micro tasks that make up a task that may be a collection of tasks makes up an objective or a larger scope of a project or challenge to mitigate. And then quantify the challenges to mitigate that are part of the larger scope. We make all those together and then you have a an intent of a group, a department, or a division overall. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know for the demo we have to demonstrate competence and understanding and awareness of the problem being solved that we can contextualize it quantify assign awareness factors to it and then create solutions for it and quantify how the solutions we've created for it will solve it and be measured. And what the impact of those measurements should be assuming everything else goes according to plan. So that's proving our understanding of the client themselves their scale size scope spread across geographic locations divisions unique needs as a manufacturer an innovator and all the other things that this company does and then the unique needs and requirements of the groups within that organization are needed to support the other groups in the company's a whole so that it can perform its stated function as a profitable corporation. To that effect the stakeholders there will be using our software that are similar to procurement but with their own unique lenses focus points. The common being clear common denominated between them all is that ultimately they are all there for the same reason or to generate resources. To support those things that matter to them they care about and sustain them and sustain those that they love and those causes and things that they choose to direct their energy and time into. That's what being their supports along with larger objective of doing big and great things potentially for this innovative company they want to be a part of as the association in these experiences helps them individually but it also helps larger community group division organization as a whole because of your station successful people will have some security you better chance at higher compensation more flexibility and resources to do and put towards the things that they love. All people have the same general goals in that way abstracted all the same so meeting that that impacts that threat that is a problem any system a process the threat that are could make look bad as a problem you make some good make him happy.
