## User Journey 1: Processing a New Shipment

### Scenario
Sarah, an ITAD professional, receives 50 Dell servers from Client ABC with PO# 12345. She needs to analyze all equipment and generate a report.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Starting Work
- **User Expectation:** "I need to tell the system I'm starting a batch for this shipment"
- **Actual Behavior:** ✓ Dashboard has "Start Batch Session" button
- **Gap:** None
- **Sentiment:** Satisfied
- **Severity:** ✓ PASS

#### Step 2: Creating Batch
- **User Expectation:** "I'll enter client name, PO number, and my name as operator"
- **Actual Behavior:** ✓ Dialog has all fields (name, operator, reference, description)
- **Gap:** None
- **Sentiment:** Satisfied
- **Severity:** ✓ PASS

#### Step 3: Scanning First Equipment
- **User Expectation:** "Now I'll go to the scanning page and start analyzing servers"
- **Actual Behavior:** User clicks "Analyze" in sidebar → **NO indication that batch is active**
- **Gap:** CRITICAL - User has no idea if their work will be tracked in the batch
- **Sentiment:** "Wait... is this going into my batch? Did I lose my batch session?"
- **Severity:** 🚨 **CRITICAL FAILURE**

#### Step 4: Analyzing Equipment
- **User Expectation:** "Each scan should be associated with my Client ABC batch automatically"
- **Actual Behavior:** **Analyses are NOT associated with active batch** (no batchId sent to API)
- **Gap:** CRITICAL - Core functionality missing
- **Sentiment:** "After 20 scans, I realize nothing went into my batch. I have to start over."
- **Severity:** 🚨 **CRITICAL FAILURE**

#### Step 5: Checking Progress
- **User Expectation:** "I want to see how many items I've processed so far"
- **Actual Behavior:** Header shows "0 analyses" because nothing is associated
- **Gap:** Complete disconnect between intent and reality
- **Sentiment:** Frustration → abandonment → loss of trust
- **Severity:** 🚨 **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**Journey 1 Result:** ❌ FAILS - User cannot complete their core job function

## User Journey 2: Reviewing Recent Analysis

### Scenario
Sarah sees an interesting analysis from yesterday and wants to review the details.

#### Step 1: Finding the Analysis
- **User Expectation:** "I see the equipment in recent analyses, I'll click on it"
- **Actual Behavior:** Item is clickable (works when clicked)
- **Gap:** Item doesn't LOOK clickable (no underline, no cursor change, no hover state)
- **Sentiment:** "Is this clickable? Let me try... oh it worked!"
- **Severity:** ⚠️ **HIGH** - Discoverability issue

#### Step 2: Viewing Details
- **User Expectation:** "I want to see full analysis including precious metals, buyer match, valuation"
- **Actual Behavior:** ✓ Dialog shows all details
- **Gap:** None
- **Sentiment:** Satisfied
- **Severity:** ✓ PASS

**Journey 2 Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS - Works but not discoverable

---

## User Journey 3: Completing a Batch

### Scenario
Sarah finishes analyzing all 50 servers and wants to complete the batch.

#### Step 1: Finding Completion Action
- **User Expectation:** "I'll look for a 'Complete Batch' or 'Finish' button"
- **Actual Behavior:** ✓ Header has batch indicator with "Complete Batch" button
- **Gap:** None
- **Sentiment:** Satisfied
- **Severity:** ✓ PASS

#### Step 2: Completing Batch
- **User Expectation:** "System will show me summary: items analyzed, total value, time spent"
- **Actual Behavior:** Just shows toast "Batch completed successfully"
- **Gap:** HIGH - No summary, no metrics, no report link
- **Sentiment:** "That's it? Where's my report? What was the total value?"
- **Severity:** ⚠️ **HIGH** - Missing critical feedback

#### Step 3: Sharing Results
- **User Expectation:** "I need to export this for my manager / client"
- **Actual Behavior:** **No export functionality** (future feature)
- **Gap:** HIGH - Cannot complete business workflow
- **Sentiment:** "I have to manually copy data into Excel?"
- **Severity:** ⚠️ **HIGH** - Incomplete workflow

**Journey 3 Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS - Works but incomplete

---

## User Journey 4: Accidentally Clicking Cancel

### Scenario
Sarah accidentally clicks "Cancel Batch" instead of "Complete Batch"

#### Step 1: Accidental Click
- **User Expectation:** "System will ask me 'Are you sure? This will discard 50 analyses'"
- **Actual Behavior:** **Immediately clears batch state, NO confirmation dialog**
- **Gap:** CRITICAL - No safety net for destructive action
- **Sentiment:** "WHAT?! I just lost 2 hours of work!"
- **Severity:** 🚨 **CRITICAL FAILURE**

#### Step 2: Backend State
- **User Expectation:** "Batch should be cancelled in database"
- **Actual Behavior:** **Frontend clears state but backend batch stays "active"**
- **Gap:** CRITICAL - State divergence between frontend and backend
- **Sentiment:** "Now I have orphaned batches in the system"
- **Severity:** 🚨 **CRITICAL FAILURE**

**Journey 4 Result:** ❌ FAILS - Destructive action without safeguards

---

## User Journey 5: Starting from Analyze Page

### Scenario
Sarah goes directly to Analyze page to scan a single item, not part of a batch.

#### Step 1: Quick Analysis
- **User Expectation:** "I'll scan one item quickly without creating a batch"
- **Actual Behavior:** ✓ Works fine, analysis saved to history
- **Gap:** None
- **Sentiment:** Satisfied
- **Severity:** ✓ PASS

#### Step 2: Realizing It's a Batch
- **User Expectation:** "Wait, this is actually part of a shipment. I should start a batch now."
- **Actual Behavior:** **No "Start Batch" button on Analyze page** - must go back to dashboard
- **Gap:** HIGH - Interrupts workflow, forces navigation
- **Sentiment:** "Why do I have to leave this page to start a batch?"
- **Severity:** ⚠️ **HIGH** - Poor workflow integration

**Journey 5 Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS - Works but friction-heavy

---

## Summary of Critical Issues

### 🚨 Critical Failures (Blocks Core Workflow)
1. **No batch integration on Analyze page** - User has no idea batch is active
2. **Analyses not auto-associated with batch** - Core feature doesn't work
3. **Cancel has no confirmation** - Destructive action without safeguard
4. **Frontend/backend state divergence** - Cancel doesn't update database

### ⚠️ High Priority (Frustrating/Confusing)
5. **Clickable items don't look clickable** - Discoverability issue
6. **No completion summary** - Missing critical feedback
7. **No batch creation from Analyze page** - Workflow interruption

### Medium Priority (Polish/Enhancement)
8. No export functionality (planned future feature)
9. No batch editing capability
10. No bulk batch operations

---

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Must Have)
1. ✅ Add batch indicator to Analyze page header
2. ✅ Auto-associate analyses with active batch in Analyze flow
3. ✅ Add confirmation dialog for Cancel Batch
4. ✅ Wire Cancel Batch to backend API or clarify behavior
5. ✅ Add visual feedback for clickable items (hover underline, cursor pointer)

### Phase 2: High Priority (Should Have)
6. ✅ Add batch completion summary dialog with metrics
7. ✅ Add "Start Batch Session" button to Analyze page
8. ✅ Show batch context in analysis results (which batch it belongs to)

### Phase 3: Polish (Nice to Have)
9. Export batch results to PDF/Excel
10. Edit batch metadata after creation
11. Bulk operations on batch items
