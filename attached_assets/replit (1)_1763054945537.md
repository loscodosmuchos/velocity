# IntelliGraph - AI Knowledge Platform

## Overview

IntelliGraph is a sophisticated AI-powered knowledge management platform that combines multi-agent orchestration with semantic analysis and knowledge graph visualization. The system enables users to upload various file types (PDFs, documents, code, images), processes them using specialized AI agents, and creates interconnected knowledge networks with relationship mapping and semantic search capabilities.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **React + TypeScript**: Modern component-based UI using React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite Build System**: Fast development server and optimized production builds

- **Wouter Router**: Lightweight client-side routing solution

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js API**: RESTful API server with middleware for file processing and error handling
- **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for different tasks (content analysis, relationship mapping, orchestration)
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates for agent status, processing progress, and system statistics
- **Modular Service Layer**: Separate services for file processing, vector operations, and AI integration

### Data Storage Solutions
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database using Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting with connection pooling
- **Vector Databases**: Multi-provider support for Pinecone, Weaviate, and Qdrant for semantic search
- **File Storage**: Local file system with Multer for upload handling

### AI Integration and Processing
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Advanced language model for content analysis and entity extraction
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic similarity search and knowledge node relationships
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Workflow management with sequential, concurrent, and handoff patterns
- **Content Processing Pipeline**: Automated text extraction, chunking, and analysis

### Authentication and Data Flow
- **Session-based Authentication**: User management with PostgreSQL storage
- **File Upload Pipeline**: Multi-format support with status tracking and progress monitoring
- **Knowledge Graph Generation**: Automated node creation and relationship mapping
- **Export System**: JSON/YAML export capabilities for knowledge base portability

## External Dependencies

### AI and Machine Learning
- **Anthropic Claude API**: Primary language model for content analysis and reasoning
- **Vector Database Providers**: Pinecone for production-scale vector search, Weaviate for semantic queries, Qdrant for local deployment

### Database and Storage
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL with automatic scaling
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries and migrations

### Development and Deployment
- **Replit Platform**: Cloud development environment with integrated deployment
- **Vite Plugins**: Development tools including error overlays and debugging utilities

### UI and Styling
- **Radix UI Primitives**: Accessible component primitives for complex UI interactions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Lucide Icons**: Consistent icon system throughout the application

### File Processing
- **Multer**: File upload middleware with size limits and type validation
- **PDF Processing**: Text extraction from PDF documents
- **Document Parsing**: Support for DOCX, markdown, and plain text files

## Recent Changes

### ✅ COMPLETED: Priority 4 - Monitoring & Observability Widget (September 22, 2025)

Successfully implemented persistent LogsViewer component with comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

**Core Features Implemented:**
- **Persistent Floating Widget**: Terminal button accessible across all pages via App-level mounting
- **Dialog Interface**: Clean modal with System Logs and System Status tabs
- **Export Functionality**: JSON download capability for log data with timestamp
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset logs with user action tracking
- **System Status**: Connection status, log statistics, and system information display

**Technical Implementation:**
- Moved from Dashboard-specific to App-level component for persistence across navigation
- Fixed React hook issues that prevented application loading
- Added proper test IDs for automated testing (logs-viewer-trigger, download-logs, clear-logs)
- Implemented proper error handling and user experience patterns

**Testing Validation:**
- Confirmed functionality across all pages: Dashboard (/), File Processing (/file-processing), Knowledge Graph (/graph)
- Validated export and clear operations work correctly
- Screenshot verification of consistent floating button positioning
- No console errors or React hook violations

**Architect Review Result:** "Pass for the LogsViewer widget itself" - core widget functionality complete

**Future Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Real-time log ingestion from WebSocket, API calls, and console
- Live system health indicators from actual backend status
- Integration with TanStack Query error handling
- Bounded log buffer with memory management
- User-facing error notification system

This completes the foundational monitoring interface requirement for Priority 4 objectives.
