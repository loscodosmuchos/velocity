## The Business Problem

### Current State Challenges

Our automotive industry client faces critical operational inefficiencies that create daily stress and business risk:

**Manual Process Friction:**
- 2-3 hours daily spent manually combining data from two separate systems (Bullhorn + client system)
- Excel-based reporting that requires constant manual updates and cross-referencing
- No real-time visibility into staffing operations and budget status
- Language barriers with English-only systems despite Korean being the executive's native language

**Reactive Management Crisis:**
- Employees hired before Purchase Orders are issued, creating system conflicts
- Contract and SOW expirations discovered only when problems arise
- Budget overruns identified after money is already spent

- Constant "firefighting" mode instead of strategic planning

**Business Impact:**
- Project delays due to staffing gaps and contract lapses
- Compliance violations from PO mismatches
- Budget overruns requiring emergency approvals
- Team stress from constant crisis management
- Executive time wasted on operational details instead of strategic initiatives
