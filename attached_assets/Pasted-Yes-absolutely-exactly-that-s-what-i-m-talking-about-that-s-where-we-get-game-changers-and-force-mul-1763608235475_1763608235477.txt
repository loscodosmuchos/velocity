Yes absolutely exactly that's what i'm talking about that's where we get game changers and force multipliers and things that really accelerate this beyond the normal you know this it's like a PKZip or a compression table right this word equals this character or this hex value so like but in this case we're using symbols symbolism I mean you can have a page that has a hundred symbols on it in a chart and then you hover over the symbol and the symbol tells you what it represents what learning what lesson or what concepts what area of trigger it is like if it's QA code review if its you know in alignment with your goal and intention if its authenticity you whatever the symbol represents its abbreviation of it and then if you click on it and you have admin rights you could see the full description of what what it's about maybe maybe just a summary but you don't get to know the whole thing like but you get you get it in a nutshell enough to know why it's there which might be the better way to do it and then you have another document which is the full definitions of all that stuff which I already have some of that stuff but just ideas there yeah and then you might say on this tasks to do this particular set of tasks it requires these eight icons right maybe the icons represent the MCP servers or they represent functions or awarenesses or focus points necessary in order for the intention to be manifest so if you want to go make this procurement report we're gonna need to make sure we look through the lens of procurement manager that we track everything we do because finance is involved and this is important and we present the data in the way that the user would want it from that position that we double-check that our numbers and formulas are correct because this is a critical function so we have a secondary set of verification on it or something right different things have different associations and requirements attached to them and ramifications if they were wrong or right you know some it's not a huge deal if it's incorrect or are missing some it's a game-changer deal-breaker maybe there's a way to use the icons to indicate that maybe there's a way to use them in other ways throughout the site both for the dev advantage and the agent as well as the user themselves you can familiarize them with it with that process as well maybe there's some best practices out there people already doing that as part of like gamification and badging and whatnot but this is a little different but um see we could do
