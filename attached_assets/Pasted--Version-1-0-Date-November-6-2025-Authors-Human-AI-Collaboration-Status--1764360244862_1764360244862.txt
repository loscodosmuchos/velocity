## 🎯 Document Purpose

**This is a meta-guide** - it documents the system I used to create all the other insight documents you see in this project.

**Target audience:** New AI instances in other Repl projects who need to replicate this insight extraction and documentation system.

**What you'll learn:**
1. How to extract valuable insights from conversations
2. How to gauge importance and prioritize
3. How to structure and format insight documents
4. How to organize files and directories
5. How to preserve context and relationships
6. How to make insights actionable and searchable

## System Overview

### The Problem This Solves

**Knowledge evaporation** - Valuable insights from conversations disappear unless systematically captured.

**Conversation flow:**
```
User: "Here's an interesting concept..."
AI: "Great analysis! Let me explore this..."
[10 messages of deep discussion]
Result: Insights lost in chat history
```

**With this system:**
```
User: "Here's an interesting concept..."
AI: "Great analysis! Let me explore this..."
[10 messages of deep discussion]
AI: Creates standalone document capturing insights
Result: Permanent, searchable, shareable knowledge
```

### Core Principles

**1. When In Doubt, Doc It Out**
- If it took >5 minutes to discuss, document it
- If it's reusable, document it
- If it matters, document it

**2. Harvest-Classify-Store-Retrieve-Deploy**
- Extract insights from conversations
- Classify by type and importance
- Store in organized structure
- Enable easy retrieval via search
- Make insights deployable/actionable

**3. Context Preservation > Raw Storage**
- Always capture WHY alongside WHAT
- Include decision history and iteration process
- Document what was rejected and why
- Preserve user quotes and rationale

**4. Progressive Enhancement**
- Start with quick capture
- Enhance with examples over time
- Link related insights
- Build knowledge graph

## The Extraction Process

### Step 1: Identify Extractable Insights

**During conversation, watch for:**

✅ **Patterns and methodologies**
- "Here's how we approach X"
- "The pattern is: A → B → C"
